{"text":"Elevated insulin receptor content in human breast cancer. The growth of breast cancer cells is under the regulation of hormones, growth factors, and their receptors. In the present study, we have employed a new, sensitive, and specific radioimmunoassay for the direct measurement of insulin receptors in surgical specimens of breast cancers. In 159 specimens the insulin receptor content was 6.15 +\/- 3.69 ng\/0.1 mg protein. This value was more than sixfold higher than the mean value found in both 27 normal breast tissues obtained at total mastectomy (0.95 + 0.68, P less than 0.001) and in six normal specimens obtained from reduction mammoplasty (0.84 +\/- 0.78, P less than 0.001). The insulin receptor content in breast cancer tissues was also higher than in any normal tissue investigated including liver (Pezzino, V., V. Papa, V. Trischitta, A. Brunetti, P.A. Goodman, M.K. Treutelaar, J.A. Williams, B.A. Maddux, R. Vigneri, and I.D. Goldfine, 1989. Am. J. Physiol. 257:E451-457). The insulin receptor in breast cancer retained its ability to both bind insulin and undergo insulin-induced tyrosine kinase activation. Immunostaining of the specimens revealed that the insulin receptor was present in malignant epithelial cells, but was not detected in stromal and inflammatory cells. Univariant analysis revealed that the insulin receptor content of the tumors correlated positively with tumor size (P = 0.014), histological grading (P = 0.030), and the estrogen receptor content (P = 0.035). There were no significant correlations between insulin receptor content and the age, body weight, menopausal status, and nodal involvement of the patients. These studies indicate, therefore, that the insulin receptor content is increased in breast cancers and raise the possibility that the insulin receptor may have a role in the biology of these tumors.

{"text":"Venous infarction following the interhemispheric approach in patients with acute subarachnoid hemorrhage. Postoperative venous infarction following aneurysm surgery was studied in 48 patients with anterior communicating artery aneurysms operated on through the interhemispheric approach at the acute stage of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Of 23 patients whose bridging veins were sacrificed during surgery, 11 (47.8%) showed venous infarction in the frontal lobes. In contrast, only one (5.9%) of 17 patients whose bridging veins were preserved developed cerebral edema. None of eight patients who were operated on after Day 11 (the day of SAH was defined as Day 0) showed this complication, although bridging veins were sacrificed in six of them. Venous infarction following acute aneurysm surgery tended to occur more frequently in patients of higher SAH grade and\/or more advanced age, but these correlations were not significant. However, the correlation between the sacrifice of veins and venous infarction was significant (p less than 0.025). Because this potential complication may compromise the benefit of acute aneurysm surgery and cause damage, it is important to preserve the venous system and in some instances to select another surgical approach based on the pattern of venous drainage in the frontal lobe.

{"text":"Trial of brief intermittent neuroleptic prophylaxis for selected schizophrenic outpatients: clinical and social outcome at two years. OBJECTIVE--To evaluate a novel approach to the prophylaxis of schizophrenic relapse characterised by administration of brief courses of neuroleptic for the earliest non-psychotic signs of relapse (prodromal symptoms). DESIGN--Two year follow up of subjects randomised, double blind, to receive either active (control group) or placebo (intermittent group) depot neuroleptic medication. Both groups received brief courses of oral neuroleptic when prodromal symptoms or relapse occurred. SETTING--Psychiatric outpatient department, Charing Cross Hospital, London. SUBJECTS--54 Stable patients in remission who met the American Psychiatric Association's DSM-III criteria for schizophrenia on the basis of case notes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Survival without relapse, survival without hospitalisation, point prevalence of extrapyramidal side effects and tardive dyskinesia, structured assessment of social functioning (social adjustment scale II), and frequency of prodromal symptoms. RESULTS--Of 19 relapses recorded over two years, 10 (53%) were preceded by non-psychotic prodromal signs. Survival rates for both relapse and hospitalisation were worse with intermittent treatment than continuous treatment over the two year follow up: 92% of controls and only 54% of patients given intermittent treatment survived the two year period without hospitalisation. Prolonged or frequent relapses as well as episodes of prodromal symptoms were more frequent with intermittent treatment. Lower scores for extrapyramidal side effects were recorded in the intermittent treatment group, but periodic assessments of social functioning failed to show any social advantages from this. CONCLUSION--The findings are at variance with a previous report of one year follow up in this cohort and attest to the superiority of continuous depot neuroleptic prophylaxis in preventing both psychotic and neurotic or dysphoric morbidity in schizophrenia.

{"text":"The effect of graded doses of insulin on peripheral glucose uptake and lactate release in cancer cachexia. With the euglycemic clamp technique, we evaluated the effects of graded doses of insulin on glucose turnover rates and forearm lactate balance in five weight-losing patients with cancer before surgery and five age- and weight-matched healthy volunteers (control subjects). Insulin was infused sequentially at increasing rates of 0.5 (low physiologic), 1.0 (high physiologic), and 4.0 (supraphysiologic) mU\/kg.min for 120 minutes each. Concurrently, rates of glucose appearance and disappearance were derived from [3-3H] glucose infusion. The mean postabsorptive rate of glucose appearance in patients (2.9 +\/- 0.1 mg\/kg.min) was significantly higher (p less than 0.02) than that of control subjects (1.98 +\/- 0.16 mg\/kg.min). Complete suppression of endogenous glucose production occurred at high physiologic insulin concentrations. With progressive insulin infusion, the rate of glucose disappearance increased to 3.6 +\/- 1.2, 8.7 +\/- 0.8, and 13.7 +\/- 1.1 mg\/kg\/min in control subjects and 2.9 +\/- 0.4, 5.3 +\/- 0.3, and 10.9 +\/- 0.9 mg\/kg.min in patients, significantly different from that of control subjects (p less than 0.05) during the intermediate (high physiologic) insulin infusion. A comparable slight increase in arterial plasma lactate concentration was observed in both groups with progressive hyperinsulinemia. Baseline peripheral lactate flux was identical in patients (-272 +\/- 56 nmol\/100 gm.min) and in controls (-271 +\/- 57 nmol\/100 gm.min). Progressive physiologic hyperinsulinemia resulted in significantly (p less than 0.05) augmented peripheral lactate efflux in patients (-824 +\/- 181 nmol\/100 gm.min) compared with control subjects (-287 +\/- 64 nmol\/100 gm.min). Supraphysiologic insulin abolished this increased lactate efflux in patients. Postabsorptive rates of endogenous glucose appearance in weight-losing patients with cancer were elevated, but complete suppression was achieved with insulin concentrations in the physiologic range. Total body glucose use was diminished in these patients, consistent with a state of insulin resistance. This impaired insulin action on peripheral glucose use was associated with an increase in peripheral lactate release in patients. ","labels_t":"digestive system diseases"}
{"text":"Peripheral arterial occlusive disease of the extremities in the United States: hospitalization and mortality. PAODE is an important cause of morbidity and health care expenditures among the elderly. Data from the NHDS and National Vital Statistics System were used to assess its impact in the U.S. In 1985 to 1987, an estimated 229 thousand men and 184 thousand women per year were discharged with any diagnosis of chronic PAODE. Discharge rates were much higher in men and increased sharply with age. Lower extremity arteriography was performed during 88 thousand hospitalizations and aorta-iliac-femoral bypass procedures were done during 31 thousand hospitalizations per year. Numbers of procedures increased markedly since 1979. An estimated 60 thousand men and 50 thousand women per year were discharged with any diagnosis of acute PAODE. Embolectomy or thrombectomy of lower limb arteries was listed for 28 thousand discharges per year. Few deaths were attributed to PAODE. Although these data are limited by likely incomplete reporting and by the nonspecificity of diagnostic codes, they provide an indication of the magnitude of the problem.

{"text":"Acute subdural hematoma: morbidity, mortality, and operative timing. Traumatic acute subdural hematoma remains one of the most lethal of all head injuries. Since 1981, it has been strongly held that the critical factor in overall outcome from acute subdural hematoma is timing of operative intervention for clot removal; those operated on within 4 hours of injury may have mortality rates as low as 30% with functional survival rates as high as 65%. Data were reviewed for 1150 severely head-injured patients (Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores 3 to 7) treated at a Level 1 trauma center between 1982 and 1987; 101 of these patients had acute subdural hematoma. Standard treatment protocol included aggressive prehospital resuscitation measures, rapid operative intervention, and aggressive postoperative control of intracranial pressure (ICP). The overall mortality rate was 66%, and 19% had functional recovery. The following variables statistically correlated (p less than 0.05) with outcome; motorcycle accident as a mechanism of injury, age over 65 years, admission GCS score of 3 or 4, and postoperative ICP greater than 45 mm Hg. The time from injury to operative evacuation of the acute subdural hematoma in regard to outcome morbidity and mortality was not statistically significant even when examined at hourly intervals although there were trends indicating that earlier surgery improved outcome. The findings of this study support the pathophysiological evidence that, in acute subdural hematoma, the extent of primary underlying brain injury is more important than the subdural clot itself in dictating outcome; therefore, the ability to control ICP is more critical to outcome than the absolute timing of subdural blood removal.

{"text":"Early afterdepolarizations and triggered activity in rabbit cardiac Purkinje fibers recovering from ischemic-like conditions. Role of acidosis. BACKGROUND. The mechanisms underlying repetitive activity during reperfusion of ischemic myocardium are thought to include triggered responses elicited at short pacing cycle lengths. The potential to generate repetitive responses at longer pacing cycle lengths under similar conditions, however, has not been explored. Thus, the present study examined the role of cycle length on the cellular electrical changes produced during recovery from ischemic-like conditions and identified the major component precipitating nondriven, repetitive activity. METHODS AND RESULTS. Transmembrane potentials were recorded in vitro from isolated rabbit Purkinje fibers exposed to hypoxia (defined as PO2 less than 30 mm Hg, high [K+]o, and zero glucose) plus lactic acidosis (pH 6.7) for 45 minutes and during recovery in normal Tyrode's solution (pH 7.4). Compared with control, action potential duration (90% repolarization) during recovery increased transiently by 40.9 +\/- 11.8 and 241.0 +\/- 51.1 msec at respective basic cycle lengths of 1,000 and 3,000 msec (both p less than 0.005). In 81% of preparations, action potential prolongation was accompanied by early afterdepolarizations and triggered activity generated from low (positive to -40 mV) or high (negative to -40 mV) membrane potentials. In 62% of experiments, brief periods of abnormal automaticity also occurred. Triggered responses were 1) unaffected by 1 microM ryanodine, 2) abolished by pacing at short basic cycle lengths or by exposing tissues to 2.5 micrograms\/ml lidocaine, and 3) more easily induced at long basic cycle lengths or by superfusing 2.5 micrograms\/ml quinidine. When tissues were conditioned with hypoxia alone (pH 7.4), action potential prolongation on recovery was comparatively small, and nondriven responses did not develop. Conversely, addition of 10-20 microM amiloride to the hypoxic, acidic test solution augmented recovery-induced action potential prolongation. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that acidosis, as a component of ischemia, plus slow pacing frequencies may mediate the genesis of early afterdepolarizations and triggered activity in Purkinje fibers on recovery, long after extracellular pH has been restored to normal. These data may have clinical relevance to the mechanisms of reperfusion arrhythmias in the intact human heart. ","labels_t":"nervous system diseases"}

There were seven esophagotracheal and nine esophagobronchial fistulas. A fistula between the esophageal diverticulum and a bronchus considered to be of inflammatory origin developed in 7 patients. A fistula as the consequence of trauma developed in 9 patients, and these fistulas were situated at a higher level of the respiratory tree. All patients underwent surgical treatment; in 12 it was definitive, and in 4 temporary gastrostomy was performed to improve nutrition before definite repair. The definitive repair consisted of eventual diverticulectomy, division of the fistula, and suture of both esophageal and respiratory defects. Two patients required esophageal resection and later reconstruction with colon interposition. One patient died, creating an operative mortality of 8.3% in the definitive-repair group. The remaining 11 patients had a gratifying long-term result. There were two deaths in the gastrostomy group due to an extremely poor condition of patients and debilitating pulmonary infection.

During this time period, there were 1,583 clean general surgical operations performed, other than biopsy of the breast, yielding an over-all wound infection rate of 1.2 per cent (p less than 0.001). A trend was noted, suggesting that use of drains may have contributed to wound infection versus no drainage (25 versus 5 per cent, respectively). Electrocautery burns requiring local wound care occurred during seven biopsies and four of these patients subsequently had a wound infection develop. Four lesions required more than one excision to remove the abnormal mammary tissue, and in four, there was a failure to remove the lesion at the first operation. Fifty-three localization procedures were performed using methylene blue. In this group, only one patient required more than one biopsy to remove the abnormal mammary tissue, and there were no failures with this technique. Also, a smaller mean volume of tissue was removed in this group versus the standard NLBB (30.2 +\/- 3.0 versus 53.3 +\/- 4.6 cubic millimeters, respectively) (p less than 0.01).

Cerebral amyloid angiopathy can present as lobar intracerebral hemorrhage in an elderly person, presumably due to increased fragility of the vessels affected by amyloid deposition. For this reason, patients presenting with intracerebral hemorrhage and suspected of having cerebral amyloid angiopathy have often been treated nonsurgically. Since 1983 we have evaluated 11 patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (nine women and two men, mean age 73 years) who have undergone either intracerebral hematoma evacuation or brain biopsy. Nine of the 11 patients presented with intracerebral hemorrhage, which was unilobar in three patients and multilobar in six and involved the parietal lobes seven times, the frontal lobes four times, the temporal lobes four times, and the occipital lobes twice. These nine patients underwent hematoma removal, with no cases of abnormal intraoperative bleeding or recurrent hemorrhage. Six patients improved neurologically, and two were unchanged after hematoma evacuation; the remaining patient had a fatal cardiopulmonary arrest during the immediate postoperative period. During follow-up in seven patients (median 11 months, range 1 week to 74 months) none experienced a recurrent intracerebral hemorrhage and four continued to improve. Two of the 11 patients had cerebral amyloid angiopathy diagnosed by brain biopsy as part of an evaluation for dementia, also without surgical complications. This series suggests that patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy may safely undergo operative procedures, and patients presenting with intracerebral hemorrhage may show neurologic improvement following evacuation of the hematoma.

Ninety percent of the IIH patients were women; the mean age was 33. Obesity and recent weight gain were much more common among patients than controls.

Several conditions previously associated with IIH were no more common in patients than controls including iron deficiency anemia, thyroid disease, pregnancy, antibiotic intake, and use of oral contraceptives. We conclude that previous studies of IIH, mostly uncontrolled and retrospective, have underestimated the frequency of symptoms in IIH patients and reported chance and spurious associations with common medical conditions and medications. The profile of a young obese woman with headaches and either TVO or ICN should alert the clinician to the diagnosis of IIH, especially when the symptoms occur daily. ","labels_t":"neoplasms"}

S3 is identical to cytochrome P450 IV A2. SA encoded a protein of 546 amino acid residues, and its carboxyl terminal region had a slight homology to luciferase. No homologous sequence has been reported in S2 sequences. S3 mRNA was about four times more abundantly expressed in the kidneys of 28-day-old SHR than in those of age-matched WKY rats, but there was no difference at age 16 weeks. A low NaCl diet positively modulated the expression of the S3 gene. S2 mRNA was almost undetectable in the kidneys of 28-day-old WKY rats but was clearly detected in those of age-matched SHR. The expression level of S2 mRNA in the livers of 16-week-old SHR was about five times higher than that of age-matched WKY rats.

SA mRNA was more than 10 times more abundantly expressed in the kidneys of SHR than in those of WKY rats from age 4 weeks. With the administration of captopril, the expressions of SA mRNA in the livers of SHR were positively modulated.

Two cell lines could be initiated only in the presence of IL-3 (TALL-103 and TALL-106), one in granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF) (TALL-101), and one in IL-2 (TALL-104); only one cell line (TALL-105) was originated in the absence of growth factors.

Pathogen-free F344 rats were inoculated intranasally with M. pulmonis or with sterile culture medium and then lived for 4 wk in an ammonia-free atmosphere or in air containing ammonia (100 parts per million). Neurogenic inflammation was evoked by an intravenous injection of capsaicin, and 5 min later the magnitude of the response was quantified by measuring the amount of extravasation of two tracers, Monastral blue pigment and Evans blue dye. We found that vascular permeability in the tracheas of all rats was normal in the absence of capsaicin. However, a 75-micrograms\/kg dose of capsaicin, which caused almost no extravasation of Evans blue in the tracheas of pathogen-free controls (17 +\/- 3 ng\/mg; mean +\/- SE), produced extensive extravasation in the infected rats (135 +\/- 18 ng\/mg; P less than 0.001). Similarly, this dose of capsaicin produced 30 times as much Monastral blue extravasation in the infected rats (area density = 47 +\/- 8% of surface area) as it did in the pathogen-free rats (1.6 +\/- 0.5%; P less than 0.001), a difference that resulted from increases in the number of Monastral blue-labeled postcapillary venules and in the amount of labeling per venule. Exposure of the infected rats to ammonia exacerbated the infections, further increased the number of Monastral blue-labeled vessels and the amount of labeling per vessel, and made the rats so sensitive to capsaicin that a normally tolerable dose of 150 micrograms\/kg i.v. caused fatal apnea. Ammonia did not have these effects in pathogen-free rats. We conclude that M. pulmonis infections of the airway mucosa cause a potent, long-lasting potentiation of neurogenic inflammation, which results in part from an increase in the number and responsiveness of mediator-sensitive postcapillary venules. These changes can be amplified by environmental factors such as ammonia which exacerbate the infections. ","labels_t":"general pathological conditions"}
{"text":"Electrocardiographic and antiarrhythmic effects of intravenous amiodarone: results of a prospective, placebo-controlled study. The antiarrhythmic efficacy of intravenously administered amiodarone was examined in a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study that involved 77 patients after coronary artery bypass surgery. Amiodarone was given after surgery in a loading bolus of 300 mg for 2 hours followed by 1200 mg every 24 hours for 2 days and 900 mg every 24 hours for the next 2 days. Amiodarone suppressed both supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias within 12 hours after the start of therapy. Particularly, the incidence of atrial fibrillation (5% vs 21% in the control group; p less than 0.05) and of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (3% vs 16%; p less than 0.05) was reduced by amiodarone. Heart rate was slowed (p less than 0.001) and repolarization--as judged by JTc interval--was prolonged compared with the control group (p less than 0.01). In two patients, amiodarone infusion was stopped because of excessive QTc prolongation. No detrimental hemodynamic effects of the drug were observed. Thus the intravenous administration of amiodarone appears to be suitable for patients in whom rapid suppression of symptomatic supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias is warranted in the presence of left ventricular dysfunction.

{"text":"Dialysis arthropathy: a clinical, biochemical, radiological and histological study of 36 patients. Out of a population of 97 haemodialysis patients, 36 patients with dialysis arthropathy were identified. Dialysis arthropathy is a chronic symmetrical polyarthritis which affected 97 per cent of the patients who had been undergoing cuprophane haemodialysis for more than 10 years. It commonly affected the shoulders, hips, hands, knees and wrists, worsening with time and extending to other joints. Fifty-eight per cent of the patients complained of morning stiffness and 47 per cent complained of exacerbation of shoulder pain during or after haemodialysis. Half of the patients also suffered from carpal tunnel syndrome, which recurred and was associated with a long-lasting disability. The most common radiological abnormality was periarticular bone cysts, followed by articular erosions and a destructive spondyloarthropathy, but clinical symptoms were more common than radiological signs. Patients with dialysis arthropathy had a higher C-reactive protein level than patients without arthropathy (18.6 mg\/l versus 11.4 mg\/l), indicative of an inflammatory process. Some of the clinical manifestations of the disease correlated with levels of C-reactive protein and ferritin. Serum ferritin levels correlated strongly with the units of blood transfused in the past five years (RS = 0.83), and the logarithm of ferritin level correlated weakly with C-reactive protein (r = 0.32). Haemarthroses were documented in 19 per cent of patients. Mean serum beta 2-microglobulin was elevated in the patients with (57.3 mg\/l) and without arthropathy (50.7 mg\/l), and there was no difference in the parathormone or aluminium levels between these groups. Articular tissue was obtained in 25 patients; beta 2-microglobulin amyloid was present in 24. Larger deposits were present in the capsular tissue, and these appeared to replace collagen bundles in eight cases. Amyloid deposits replaced the lining layer in six cases. It is likely therefore that amyloid disrupts normal joint function by replacing normal joint tissue. Mild chronic synovitis with haemosiderin deposition were found in approximately 60 per cent of cases. These findings suggest that amyloid derived from beta 2-microglobulin has a primary role in the pathogenesis of dialysis arthropathy, but there was also evidence of inflammatory processes. It is suggested that iron overload or haemarthroses might contribute to the inflammation, but other factors, such as dialysis-related bioincompatibility reactions, may also have a role.

Serologic data on HBV and HIV-1, cytometric enumeration of CD4+ lymphocytes, clinical events (AIDS by Centers for Disease Control criteria) and hepatitis B vaccination histories were available on 4,498 homosexual participants in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, Men were classified as to previous infection with HBV and prevalent or incident infection with HIV-1. Although there was an association between seropositivity for HBV infection and HIV-1 infection at enrollment (odds ratios anti-HBc 2.6; HBsAg 4.2), the relation between HBV seropositivity and subsequent seroconversion to HIV-1 was weaker (odds ratios 1.3 and 1.6). HIV-1 seroconversion was also associated with a history of certain other sexually transmitted diseases, but predisposing sexual practices did not account for the association between HBV and HIV-1 infection. Seropositivity for HBV infection at entry was not related to initially low or more rapid subsequent decline in T-helper lymphocyte counts and was not associated with an increased incidence of AIDS during 2.5 years of follow-up. History of vaccination against HBV did not appear to decrease susceptibility to HIV-1 infection or to subsequent progression of immunodeficiency.

The recovery time of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis after curative resection of adrenal tumors in patients with Cushing's syndrome is poorly documented. Eight consecutive patients were treated with a standardized hydrocortisone replacement strategy after curative resection of a cortisol-secreting tumor and the time to recovery of the HPA axis was determined. Hypercortisolism was documented by elevated 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels. Cure was documented by undetectable postoperative morning serum cortisol levels. Each patient received replacement hydrocortisone after surgery and was reevaluated every 3 to 6 months with an adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test. Each patient was also monitored carefully for symptoms and signs of adrenal insufficiency, which was defined as symptoms consistent with this diagnosis that responded to increases in hydrocortisone levels. After surgical resection, each patient was cured of hypercortisolism. Subsequently, despite replacement hydrocortisone, each patient had symptoms of hypocortisolism, and in four of eight patients the dose of hydrocortisone was increased to relieve the symptoms. Patients required a median time of 15 months (range, 9 to 22 months) to recover a normal ACTH stimulation test and 19 months (range, 12 to 24 months) to allow discontinuation of replacement doses of hydrocortisone. The results suggest that surgical resection of a cortisol-secreting adrenal tumor will result in rapid cure of hypercortisolism, but complete recovery of the HPA axis and discontinuation of replacement steroids will require between 1 and 2 years.

In the US, both chenodeoxycholate and ursodeoxycholate are now available. Ursodeoxycholate is more expensive but appears to produce fewer side effects and may be more efficacious. These agents are most effective in thin women with small floating, radiolucent cholesterol stones in a functioning gallbladder.

The prevalence of a mechanically defective lower esophageal sphincter, esophageal acid exposure time, and the frequency of nonperistaltic esophageal contractions during the supine, upright, and meal periods increased with increasing severity of mucosal injury. The median amplitude of esophageal contractions was compromised only in patients with a mechanically defective sphincter. This was particularly so in patients with stricture or Barrett's esophagus and was associated with an increased frequency of ineffective contractions (less than 30 mm Hg). These data show that esophageal motor function deteriorates with increasing severity of mucosal injury.

{"text":"A new method for quantification of regurgitant flow rate using color Doppler flow imaging of the flow convergence region proximal to a discrete orifice. An in vitro study. While color Doppler flow mapping has yielded a quick and relatively sensitive method for visualizing the turbulent jets generated in valvular insufficiency, quantification of the degree of valvular insufficiency has been limited by the dependence of visualization of turbulent jets on hemodynamic as well as instrument-related factors. Color Doppler flow imaging, however, does have the capability of reliably showing the spatial relations of laminar flows. An area where flow accelerates proximal to a regurgitant orifice is commonly visualized on the left ventricular side of a mitral regurgitant orifice, especially when imaging is performed with high gain and a low pulse repetition frequency. This area of flow convergence, where the flow stream narrows symmetrically, can be quantified because velocity and the flow cross-sectional area change in inverse proportion along streamlines centered at the orifice. In this study, a gravity-driven constant-flow system with five sharp-edged diaphragm orifices (ranging from 2.9 to 12 mm in diameter) was imaged both parallel and perpendicular to the direction of flow through the orifice. Color Doppler flow images were produced by zero shifting so that the abrupt change in display color occurred at different velocities. This \"aliasing boundary\" with a known velocity and a measurable radial distance from the center of the orifice was used to determine an isovelocity hemisphere such that flow rate through the orifice was calculated as 2 pi r2 x Vr, where r is the radial distance from the center of the orifice to the color change and Vr is the velocity at which the color change was noted. Using Vr values from 54 to 14 cm\/sec obtained with a 3.75-MHz transducer and from 75 to 18 cm\/sec obtained with a 2.5-MHz transducer, we calculated flow rates and found them to correlate with measured flow rates (r = 0.94-0.99). The slope of the regression line was closest to unity when the lowest Vr and the correspondingly largest r were used in the calculation. The flow rates estimated from color Doppler flow imaging could also be used in conjunction with continuous-wave Doppler measurements of the maximal velocity of flow through the orifice to calculate orifice areas (r = 0.75-0.96 correlation with measured areas).

The presence of bacterial antigen in urine was not helpful in identifying bacterial infection. Extrapulmonary and intrapleural complications, concomitant measles, complicated ALRI, female gender, and malnutrition were associated with increased mortality among children with ALRI. The importance of measles immunization, vitamin A supplementation for alleviation of defects associated with malnutrition, and timely antimicrobial therapy is emphasized.

{"text":"Components of delay time in suspected acute myocardial infarction with particular emphasis on patient delay. Two hundred and thirty-four patients admitted to a coronary care unit (CCU) were interviewed a few days after arrival in hospital to determine reasons for patient delay and the various components of total delay time from onset of symptoms to arrival in CCU. Of the three major components of delay, decision time (time from onset of symptoms to decision to go to hospital), and hospital procedure time (time from arrival in hospital to arrival in the CCU), were of the same magnitude, 1 h 15 min and 1 h 30 min (median), whereas the median time for preparation and transportation to hospital was somewhat shorter, being 45 min. Decision time appeared to be similar in patients with confirmed and non-confirmed acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and was not associated with intensity of pain or infarct size. Half of the patients hesitated to go to hospital, which resulted in a prolonged decision delay (3 h). It is concluded that patient indecision to seek medical help is the most important reason for delay in hospital arrival in patients with suspected AMI. ","labels_t":"nervous system diseases"}

Prostheses were divided into four zones: head (including acetabulum), trochanter, shaft, and tip. The presence (or absence) and intensity of activity in each zone was noted, and compared to the corresponding contralateral zone. Though present in all 23 infected arthroplasties, periprosthetic activity was also present in 77% of uninfected arthroplasties, and was greater than the contralateral zone 51% of the time. When analyzed by zone, head zone activity was the best criterion for infection (87% sensitivity, 94% specificity, 92% accuracy). Fifty of the arthroplasties were studied with combined labeled leukocyte\/sulfur colloid imaging. Using incongruence of images as the criterion for infection, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the study were 100%, 97%, and 98%, respectively. While variable periprosthetic activity makes labeled leukocyte imaging alone unreliable for diagnosing hip arthroplasty infection, the addition of sulfur colloid imaging results in a highly accurate diagnostic procedure.

{"text":"Flow cytometric DNA analysis of parathyroid tumors. Implication of aneuploidy for pathologic and biologic classification. The previous cytometric studies on parathyroid tumors have provided conflicting data regarding the relationship between DNA content and histopathology, resulting from differences in technical methods and data analysis. This study measured nuclear DNA of parathyroid tumors by flow cytometry in fresh material and determined whether DNA aneuploidy really assists in making a pathologic diagnosis of carcinoma or not. From May 1987 through April 1989, 65 consecutive patients operated on for primary hyperparathyroidism had DNA analysis of the freshly excised parathyroid tumors. Three of the patients had metastatic lesions of parathyroid carcinoma in the lung, cervical lymph nodes, and lung and mediastinal lymph nodes, respectively. Pathologic classifications of the lesions from the other 62 patients were 54 adenomas, four carcinomas, and four hyperplasias. In all the latter patients, hyperplasia was associated with a multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome. Unequivocal evidence of aneuploidy was found in all of the metastatic lesions and 60% of the primary lesions of the carcinomas, in 9% of the adenomas and in 50% of the hyperplasias. Therefore, parathyroid carcinomas were more apt to be aneuploid than were adenomas (P = 0.0015, both-sided testing). In each of the cases of aneuploid hyperplasia, a small aneuploid peak was found. The high incidence of aneuploidy in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 may indicate the presence of clonal heterogeneity of hyperplastic glands and the presence of an abnormal subset of cells that have malignant potential. Cell distribution analysis did not provide any significant information beyond ploidy level. In conclusion, DNA flow cytometric analysis of DNA ploidy patterns is a valuable adjunct to the histopathologic diagnosis of parathyroid neoplasms. ","labels_t":"digestive system diseases"}

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study, 13 patients with primary hypothyroidism were identified among 382 consecutive PTCA cases in 1987. Twenty-two euthyroid PTCA control subjects and 13 hypothyroid patients who underwent coronary artery bypass surgery (CAB) were identified for comparison. RESULTS: Hypothyroid and euthyroid PTCA patients had similar mean ages, numbers of prior and recent acute myocardial infarctions, diseased coronary arteries, coronary arteries dilated, and serum cholesterol levels. There were no significant differences in procedure-related mortality (0% versus 0%); coronary artery dissection (23% versus 23%); reocclusion (8% versus 5%); bradycardia (0% versus 0%); heart failure (0% versus 5%); hypotension (31% versus 27%); myocardial infarction (8% versus 0%); gastrointestinal dysfunction (0% versus 0%); neuropsychiatric disturbance (15% versus 9%); hyponatremia (23% versus 23%); hypothermia (0% versus 0%); or fever (15% versus 5%). Hematoma formation tended to be more frequent in the hypothyroid group (38% versus 18%, p = 0.18). Similar results were obtained when the subgroup of more severely hypothyroid patients (thyrotropin level more than 20 mU\/L, n = 7) was examined. Compared to hypothyroid CAB patients, hypothyroid PTCA patients had less incidence of heart failure (0% versus 31%, p less than 0.025); neuropsychiatric disturbance (15% versus 54%, p less than 0.025); hyponatremia (23% versus 62%, p less than 0.05); gastrointestinal dysfunction (0% versus 23%, p less than 0.025); and fever (15% versus 62%, p less than 0.001).

{"text":"Biphasic effects of doxorubicin on the calcium release channel from sarcoplasmic reticulum of cardiac muscle. To define the mechanism of doxorubicin cardiotoxicity, the effects of doxorubicin and caffeine were examined on calcium release channels from cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum. We found that calcium release from cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles was induced by both compounds. When sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles were incorporated into planar lipid bilayers, calcium-permeable channels were observed. Addition of caffeine (2.5-10 mM) increased channel open probability from less than 0.1% to 40%, and this effect persisted for a mean of 44 minutes. In contrast, doxorubicin (2.5-10 microM) had a biphasic effect; initially, doxorubicin activated the channel, whereas after a mean of 8 minutes, the channel became irreversibly inhibited. Although the degree of channel activation by doxorubicin was concentration dependent, the time needed to inactivate the channel was concentration independent. Pretreatment with dithiothreitol (0.2 mM) prevented doxorubicin-induced channel inactivation, and channel activity persisted for an average of 58 minutes. Dithiothreitol alone did not alter channel open probability. Our results support the hypotheses that 1) the integrity of sulfhydryl groups is important for some aspects of calcium release channel function and 2) activation and inactivation of the channel are separable processes. The biphasic effect of doxorubicin on channel function may also correspond to the clinically observed adverse effects of doxorubicin, a widely used chemotherapeutic agent that, after prolonged usage, causes a dilated cardiomyopathy.

{"text":"Radiographic manifestations of congenital anomalies affecting the airway. Congenital anomalies of the airway are generally uncommon, but a vast array of possibilities exists. Some present life-threatening emergencies at birth, and others go undiagnosed for years. Clinical symptoms are often nonspecific, and radiographic evaluation is frequently requested to localize and characterize the lesion before endoscopy, surgery, or medical management. The most common intrinsic congenital anomalies causing airway compromise in infants include choanal atresia, mandibular hypoplasia, laryngomalacia, vocal cord paralysis, and congenital subglottic stenosis. The radiologist must be on the alert for unsuspected additional anomalies involving the airway, lungs, and esophagus, which occur with relative frequency. Numerous extrinsic congenital masses of the head, neck, and mediastinum may compromise the airway. Hemangiomas, lymphangiomas, and teratomas are more likely to be noted at birth, whereas branchial cleft cysts, thyroglossal duct anomalies, and dermoid cysts frequently present later. Mass location and radiographic characteristics usually allow accurate preoperative diagnosis. Intracranial involvement by nasal or nasopharyngeal masses, intrathoracic involvement by lower neck mass, and intraspinal involvement by posterior neck mass must always be sought for radiographically. Persistence of respiratory symptoms after removal of such masses is not uncommon because tracheal deformity and laxity may take months or years to resolve. Recent advances in cine CT and MR imaging promise to improve imaging of the airway in general and in the pediatric population in particular. Significant limitations in imaging of the pediatric larynx remain. As a result, endoscopy continues to be the primary diagnostic tool for airway anomalies of this region.

Hyperplastic MG thymus cells gave significantly higher and more consistent responses to AChR than parallel cultures of autologous blood cells, whereas responses to PPD showed an opposite trend. Thus there was a preferential localization of AChR-reactive T cells in the hyperplastic MG thymus. Furthermore, there was a strong correlation between blood and thymus cell responses to PPD (but not to AChR), arguing that the hyperplastic MG thymus contains a sample of sensitized peripheral T cells. By contrast, both AChR- and PPD-responsive T cells were almost undetectable in thymus from nonmyasthenic patients, which is evidently much less receptive to circulating T cells. Cells from MG thymomas showed the highest stimulations by AChR but did not consistently react to PPD. However, the uninvolved thymus adjacent to these thymomas behaved almost identically to the hyperplastic samples described above. Our interpretation is that AChR-specific T cells are initially sensitized in the MG thymoma but are selectively trapped in the hyperplastic thymus after being primed elsewhere.

Only recently has the Histiocyte Society established a criterion for a \"definitive diagnosis\" of Langerhans cell histiocytosis--the presence of Birbeck granules within the cells of the histiocytic infiltrate. We report the fatal outcome of Langerhans cell histiocytosis in monozygotic twin infants. There is no satisfactory explanation why Langerhans cell histiocytosis occurs concurrently in twins. We suggest that cytokines may provide an endogenous signal that triggers the pathologic proliferation of Langerhans cells. ","labels_t":"general pathological conditions"}
{"text":"New active analogues of vitamin D with low calcemic activity. In conclusion, a number vitamin D analogues have been developed that have very low calcemic activity but retain several other properties of 1,25-(OH)2D3, including the ability to differentiate leukemia and skin cells, to enhance the immune response, and to suppress parathyroid hormone levels. Although the mechanism of this selective activity is not yet clear, these analogues may provide new insights into the differences in action of 1,25-(OH)2D3 in various target tissues. Most importantly, the selective action of these analogues may be exploited for the treatment of diseases such as leukemia, psoriasis and hyperparathyroidism. ","labels_t":"digestive system diseases"}

These symptoms were: 1) \"angina,\" resistant to O2 and nitrates, with biochemical stigmata of infarction, but without electrocardiogram (ECG) localization; 2) intractable persistent hypotension, not hypovolemic, lasting 1 or 2 days; 3) esophagal spasms, with inability to swallow solid food. Because we knew that these symptoms were compatible with hemolysis (biochemically proven by the increase in serum LDH during dialysis and by a fall in haptoglobin) due to red cell fragmentation (RCF), we switched these patients from fistula dialysis (A) to central catheter dialysis (B), with the same apperture, blood flow, etc. The total number of sessions of A versus B were 512 and 891; the mean LDH ratios (serum LDH postdialysis divided by predialysis) were 1.8 and 1.0 (= no RCF); angina events were 132 (26%) for A, and 25 (3%) for B; persistent hypotension was seen 37 (7%) times in A and 5 (0.6%) times in B; esophagal spasms were noted 65 (13%) times for A, and 0 times for B.

We evaluated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of neopterin, a putative marker of activated macrophages, in 97 subjects infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 who had a spectrum of neurological complications. The highest CSF neopterin concentrations occurred in those with neurological opportunistic infections, primary central nervous systems lymphoma, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) dementia complex. In general, the CSF concentration of neopterin was independent of CSF cell count and blood-brain barrier disruption to albumin. In the patients with AIDS dementia complex, CSF neopterin concentrations correlated with severity of disease and decreased in conjunction with clinical improvement following treatment with zidovudine. These results suggest that CSF neopterin, although not disease-specific, may be useful as a surrogate marker for the presence of AIDS dementia complex and its response to antiviral therapy.

Emergency percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass support was instituted in 11 patients in cardiac arrest refractory to conventional resuscitation measures. Emergency percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass support was used in five patients in whom cardiac arrest occurred as a result of a complication in the cardiac catheterization laboratory (group 1) and in six other patients in cardiac arrest (group II). A 21F cannula and a 17F cannula were percutaneously inserted into the femoral vein and artery. Flow rates of 3 to 5 L\/min were achieved with restoration of mean arterial pressure to 70 mm Hg (range 50 to 75). The status of all 11 patients was improved initially both clinically and hemodynamically with percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass. Of the group II patients, three had anatomy unsuitable for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or coronary bypass grafting, could not be weaned from cardiopulmonary support, and died; three of these patients had coronary artery bypass grafting and two survived. All five group I patients underwent successful coronary bypass grafting and survived. Of the seven patients with anatomically correctable disease, all seven were discharged from the hospital. With conventional management nearly all seven of these patients would have died. Nine of 11 patients underwent a cardiac operation and seven of the nine survived. The operative mortality rate was 22% and the overall survival rate was 64%. At follow-up (mean 7 months), all seven patients are alive and six have resumed a normal and active life-style. In conclusion, emergency percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass support is a powerful resuscitative tool that may stabilize the condition of patients in cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest to allow for definitive intervention.

In all, the target lesion was located on the last patent vessel. The pump was inserted under local anesthesia, without any graft. A specially designed occluder permitted avoidance of retrograde bleeding during implantation. The bypass flow ranged from 2.5 to 3.2 L\/min, and permitted a rise in cardiac index from 2.05 to 2.55 L\/min\/m2, with a drop in capillary wedge pressure from 13 (7-18) to 10 (7-13) mmHg.

Although both endoscopic and external approaches have been described, the endoscopic laser technique is more desirable because it requires no incision and allows for the immediate assessment of airway size. Eleven patients with bilateral vocal cord paralysis treated by endoscopic laser arytenoidectomy were presented in 1984. At that time, 10 of the 11 patients had been successfully decannulated. Follow-up on that group of patients revealed that 7 of the 10 successfully treated patients remain decannulated with a good airway, although 2 of these patients required a revision procedure to excise a granuloma. One patient failed at 15 months and has failed two subsequent revision operations, and 2 patients have been lost to follow-up. Since 1984, 17 additional patients with bilateral vocal cord paralysis have been treated by the authors using the same endoscopic laser arytenoidectomy technique; all have been successfully managed, with a minimum follow-up of 3 years.

Mediolysis is associated with marked segmental thinning of the vessel wall, often with only the adventitia intact. Fibrin is deposited at the adventitial and medial surfaces, and hemorrhage into the media may occur. As in this reported case, lysis of the adventitia leads to sudden, often catastrophic intraabdominal hemorrhage. Little associated adventitial inflammation occurred.

{"text":"Timing of corticosteroid treatment. Effect of lung lymph dynamics in air injury in awake sheep. In paired experiments, we studied the effects of high-dose methylprednisolone on the acute pulmonary injury caused by 4 h of venous air embolization in 19 chronically instrumented, unanesthetized sheep with lung lymph fistulas. We compared the effect of methylprednisolone (30 mg\/kg intravenous bolus) given before embolization, early (1 H) in the course of embolization, late (3 h) in the course of embolization, or after embolization (at the beginning of the recovery period). We measured pulmonary hemodynamics and lymph dynamics. In six sheep we also fixed lung tissue for semiquantitative histology, and in some we measured leukocyte concentrations in blood and in pulmonary lymph. Methylprednisolone did not significantly affect pulmonary hemodynamics but it largely prevented lung injury when it was given before embolization. It also lessened the degree of lung injury when it was given during embolization, although this effect became less marked as treatment was delayed. Methylprednisolone had no effect on lung injury when given after embolization was completed (4 h). We found fewer leukocytes attached to air emboli and fewer endothelial cell gaps in the lungs of sheep given methylprednisolone as prophylaxis. Leukocyte counts were lower in lung lymph and higher in the circulating blood of methylprednisolone-treated sheep. We conclude that methylprednisolone has a preventive effect on air embolism lung injury, such that its effect is greater when given earlier during the development of injury.

{"text":"Ultrasound-guided hepatic cryosurgery in the treatment of metastatic colon carcinoma. Preliminary results. Cryosurgery, the in situ freezing of cancer, has been proposed in the past as a possible treatment for unresectable hepatic tumors. Its advantage lies in the fact that it is a very focal treatment sacrificing less normal tissue than surgical resection, allowing treatment of multiple lobes. Because cryosurgery does not affect large vessels, tumors in difficult locations, such as adjacent to the inferior vena cava (IVC), can be treated. With the use of intraoperative ultrasound to place the cryoprobes and monitor the freezing process, 18 patients with unresectable metastatic colon carcinoma confined to the liver were treated. Of the 18 patients treated, 4 (22%) are in complete remission as determined by computed tomography (CT) scans and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, with a mean follow-up of 28.8 months. Four patients (22%) were not adequately treated at the time of cryosurgery. The number of lesions frozen in each patient ranged from 1 to 12, with a mean of 6 lesions. Fourteen patients had bilobar disease; three patients had previous right lobectomies with recurrences in their remaining left lobes prior to cryosurgery, and one patient had unilobar disease. Mean survival of the 14 cases with recurrence was 21.4 months, with 2 of the 14 still alive. Ultrasound-guided hepatic cryosurgery appears to be an effective treatment for metastatic colon carcinoma to the liver that is unresectable (including patients with bilobar and multiple lesions).

{"text":"Studies on the pathogenesis of hypertension in Cushing's disease and acromegaly. The pathogenesis of the hypertension associated with Cushing's syndrome and with acromegaly is poorly understood. We have investigated the possible roles of sodium retention, activation of the renin-angiotensin system and increased sympathetic nervous system activity in untreated patients. In 11 patients with Cushing's disease, seven of whom were hypertensive, total exchangeable sodium was normal despite increased levels of the mineralocorticoid hormones, 11-deoxy-corticosterone and corticosterone. The renin-angiotensin system was also normal. Cardiac sensitivity to the beta-receptor agonist isoprenaline was increased, but this was not due to an increase in beta-adrenoceptor density. Hypertension in Cushing's disease is neither sodium-dependent nor angiotensin II-mediated, but increased cardiac sensitivity to catecholamines, by increasing cardiac output, may contribute to the pathogenesis of hypertension. In nine patients with acromegaly (three of whom were hypertensive) total exchangeable sodium was elevated. Although no correlation between blood pressure and exchangeable sodium was found, hypertension in acromegaly is probably sodium dependent. No evidence was found for a pathogenetic role for either the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone or the sympathetic nervous system. ","labels_t":"nervous system diseases"}

The effect of volume expansion of extracellular fluid on gastroduodenal resistance to the flow of isotonic saline was assessed in three groups of rats using intravenous infusions of isotonic, isotonic-isoncotic, and isotonic-isoncotic-isohaemic solutions. The gastroduodenal segment of 29 male Wistar rats was barostatically perfused at a constant pressure gradient of 4 cm H2O and changes in flow (ml\/minute) were taken as a reflection of changes in gastroduodenal resistance. Isotonic expansion led to a 33% drop in gastroduodenal flow compared with the normovolaemic period in the same animals (p less than 0.01). Extracellular fluid expansion with isotonic-isoncotic and isotonic-isoncotic-isohaemic solutions was associated with reductions in gastroduodenal flow of 29% (p less than 0.05) and 31% (p less than 0.01) respectively. The increase in gastroduodenal resistance is due to hypervolaemia per se and not to haemodilution, decreases in plasma oncotic pressure, or electrolyte imbalance. The effect of hypervolaemia on gastroduodenal resistance, which was reversed by small haemorrhages (0.5-1.0 ml per 100 g body weight), may be due to changes in tonus or phasic motor activity, or both, and may be part of the homeostatic processes that help the organism minimise liquid volume excess.

{"text":"What is the best predictor of spontaneous ventricular tachycardia and sudden death after myocardial infarction? BACKGROUND. Death during the first year after myocardial infarction is most commonly due to spontaneous ventricular tachycardia (VT) or fibrillation (VF). The purpose of this study was to compare, in a single cohort of patients, the values of inducible VT, delayed ventricular activation, low left ventricular ejection fraction, high-grade ventricular ectopy, and ST segment displacement on exercise in predicting electrical events (witnessed instantaneous death and spontaneous VT or VF) during the first year after myocardial infarction. METHODS AND RESULTS. Three hundred sixty one patients aged less than 71 years underwent electrophysiological study, signal-averaged electrocardiogram, gated blood-pool scan, 24 hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, and exercise testing 1-2 weeks after myocardial infarction and were then followed up for at least 1 year. There were 34 deaths (eight witnessed instantaneous, 26 other), and nine patients survived one or more episodes of spontaneous VF or VT. Patients with inducible VT were 15.2 times more likely to suffer electrical events than patients without inducible VT. No proportional-hazards model excluding inducible VT was as good a predictor of electrical events as was inducible VT alone. CONCLUSIONS. Inducible VT at electrophysiological study was the single best predictor of spontaneous VT and sudden death after myocardial infarction. ","labels_t":"general pathological conditions"}

Thirty-six patients reported the occurrence of one or more syncopal episodes (group 1) and 65 patients had no syncope (group 2). These two groups did not differ significantly with regard to age, gender, incidence and characteristics of arrhythmia, clinical history, frequency of arrhythmic events and presence of associated cardiac disease. There were 10 patients in group 1 and 12 in group 2 who had ventricular fibrillation. There were no statistical differences between the two groups with respect to the effective refractory period of the right atrium, atrioventricular node, accessory pathway and right ventricle. Furthermore, no differences between the two groups were noted with respect to cycle length of circus movement tachycardia, mean heart rate during atrial fibrillation, and minimum RR interval during atrial fibrillation. In addition, the accessory pathway location was not significantly different between group 1 and group 2. The occurrence of syncope could not be predicted from any electrophysiologic finding and this symptom had a low sensitivity and specificity for recognition of dangerous rapid heart rates.

{"text":"Glutathione S-transferase. Novel vaccine against Fasciola hepatica infection in sheep. The potential of GST as a vaccine candidate against liver fluke infection in ruminants was studied by vaccinating sheep (n = 9) with GST purified from adult worms of Fasciola hepatica and challenging with 500 F. hepatica metacercariae. The immunization induced a high antibody response to GST in contrast to the poor or undetectable response to this Ag observed in naturally infected sheep. Throughout the trial, the progress of the fluke infection was monitored by measuring RBC hemoglobin levels, the extent of liver damage and the fecal egg output in the sheep. This analysis indicated that a subpopulation (n = 4) of the GST vaccinated animals exhibited no anemia, reduced liver damage and a lower mean fecal egg count relative to the infected control group suggesting a lower fluke burden in these animals. Worm burdens in the livers of the GST vaccine group (107 +\/- 22) were 57% lower than in the infected control group (250 +\/- 25). The subpopulation of the GST vaccine group demonstrated a 78% reduction in mean worm burdens relative to the control group. These results show that GST of adult F. hepatica is a novel Ag that can significantly protect sheep against liver fluke infection. The results suggest that the immune response to GST is directed to the juvenile worm reducing the number of worms that can establish in the liver of the vaccinated animals.

Their management, particularly the role of surgical removal, is controversial. Deterioration often occurs late, and is unpredictable. Eight patients with traumatic intracerebral haematomas were admitted to the neurosurgical unit to monitor their clinical state. All were studied within 48 hours of admission with single photon emission computerised tomography (SPECT), using the recently introduced radionuclide 99Technetiumm-Hexamethyl propylene amine oxime (99Tcm-HMPAO). At the time of the SPECT study, all the patients had been clinically stable. Three patients remained so; in the other five, the conscious level deteriorated, necessitating craniotomy and evacuation of the haematoma. In all the patients, the SPECT studies demonstrated perfusion defects that corresponded to the location of the haematoma, as demonstrated by computerised tomography (CT). However, in the five patients who subsequently deteriorated, the perfusion defects seen on the SPECT scan appeared larger than the haematoma, as seen on the CT scan. In addition, there was widespread poor retention of 99Tcm-HMPAO in the ipsilateral hemisphere. These differences were quantifiable. Interestingly, these differences were present at a time when the patients were clinically stable, before their deterioration. It is concluded that SPECT studies with 99Tcm-HMPAO are of possible use as predictors of late deterioration in the management of traumatic intracerebral haematomas.

Leukotriene C4 formation returns to prechallenge levels within 3 hours, although erosions still persist. Intragastric 0.2N NaOH, acidified 100 mmol\/L taurocholate, 25% NaCl, or 0.6N HCl did not consistently increase leukotriene C4 formation despite severe mucosal injury. A number of sulfhydryl-containing or sulfhydryl-blocking agents as well as metals protected against mucosal damage and simultaneously prevented the stimulation of leukotriene C4 formation induced by ethanol. None of the agents increased and some virtually abolished mucosal formation of prostaglandin E2, indicating that gastroprotection can occur completely independently of the endogenous prostaglandin system. The leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitor MK-886 markedly suppressed gastric leukotriene C4 formation but did not protect against damage caused by ethanol, NaOH, NaCl, or acidified taurocholate. Oral indomethacin reduced the ex vivo formation of both prostaglandin E2 and, to a lesser extent, leukotriene C4 in the gastric mucosa, inducing a shift in the balance from protective prostaglandins to proulcerogenic leukotriene C4. Pretreatment with MK-886, however, did not significantly diminish indomethacin-induced lesions. These data suggest that leukotriene C4 is not the exclusive mediator of gastric injury caused by necrotizing agents or indomethacin.

{"text":"The auditory P300 event-related potential: an objective marker of the encephalopathy of chronic liver disease. Recently many variants of electroencephalogram-evoked responses have been studied as potential diagnostic aids in the detection and evaluation of hepatic encephalopathy. This study assesses the value of the auditory P300 event-related potential--a slow component of the auditory evoked response--as a tool in this field. Twenty-one nonencephalopathic and 12 encephalopathic (grade 1\/2) cirrhotic patients and 26 controls were assessed clinically and psychometrically. Electroencephalogram spectral analysis and visual evoked response recordings were also conducted. An auditory P300 wave was elicited using the standard two-tone discrimination paradigm. The latency and amplitude of this wave were measured. The latency of the P300 was found to be significantly increased in the encephalopathic patients compared with both nonencephalopathic cirrhotic and control groups (p less than 0.05). Amplitude of the wave was decreased in both nonencephalopathic and encephalopathic patients, but this was not statistically significant. This study suggests that the latency of the P300 is a good marker of grades 1 and 2 clinical hepatic encephalopathy. The delays in the P300 latency may indicate that encephalopathic patients have a deterioration of their stimulus evaluation abilities. ","labels_t":"neoplasms"}

The immunohistochemical distribution and concentrations of tumor-antigen 4 (TA-4) in tissues and serum were determined in patients with benign and malignant diseases, including 27 patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC; 15 in the lung and 12 in the esophagus). Tumor-antigen 4 immunoreactivity was present in the cytoplasm of many SCC tissues, especially in the hyperparakeratotic region, and in the cytoplasm of differentiated squamous cells of the intermediate layer of normal epithelia of various organs, but not in those of other types of lung cancers or benign pulmonary diseases. Consistent with the results of immunostaining, the TA-4 concentrations in SCC tissues of the lung, esophagus, and normal squamous epithelia were much higher than in those of lung cancer other than SCC, benign pulmonary diseases, normal lung, and submandibular gland tissues. The TA-4 concentration in SCC tissue tended to increase with increasing grades of differentiation. Serum TA-4 was elevated in 15 of 27 patients with SCC but in no patients with other types of lung cancer or benign diseases. These results indicate that TA-4 is an antigen related to the differentiation of squamous cells and that tumor cells of SCC can release a large amount of TA-4 into circulation whereas normal squamous epithelia cannot.

{"text":"End-stage renal disease--is infrainguinal limb revascularization justified? Reports of reconstructive surgery for peripheral vascular disease have been relatively uncommon in patients with end-stage renal disease. Between 1980 and 1989, 39 patients with end-stage renal disease underwent revascularization of 56 limbs. Fifty-two primary infrainguinal and four secondary infrainguinal bypass grafts were performed. In addition, nine thrombectomies were performed. At the time of surgery 37 patients were on dialysis; three had functioning kidney transplants. The indications for revascularization were gangrene, rest pain, or ulceration in all except three limbs with disabling claudication. Reversed, nonreversed, or in situ vein was used in 25 of the 52 primary infrainguinal revascularizations performed. Polytetrafluoroethylene was used in 25. Two procedures used a combination of polytetrafluoroethylene and vein. The primary patencies for all infrainguinal procedures at 1 and 2 years were 77% and 68%, respectively. Four perioperative deaths occurred in the infrainguinal group (7.7%). An additional death occurred after thrombectomy for late graft closure. Three deaths were a result of myocardial infarction. One patient on peritoneal dialysis developed uncontrolled sepsis. At 3 years 39% of patients were alive, and 84% of the limbs were salvaged. Among the cases studied no group was identified that represented unacceptable operative risk. Results compared well with reported patencies for patients subjected to infrainguinal revascularization procedures.

Sensory perception thresholds were assessed by clinical testing and by quantitative instrumental testing before and after operation in 16 subjects for whom unilateral percutaneous cervical cordotomy was performed for the relief of pain due to malignant disease, and compared with clinical assessments of sensory function. We were able to confirm the association between deficit in pin-prick sensation and pain relief in the majority of instances, though the completeness or otherwise of pain relief does not correspond to absence of pin-prick sensation. There is no objective interference with low threshold mechanical sensation as measured instrumentally, although cordotomised subjects do not experience startle, tickle, or cutaneous erotic sensation when subjected to appropriate low intensity tactile sensation. Quantitative instrumental testing shows that the greatest deficits produced by cordotomy are in the sensations of skinfold pinch (? = tissue-damage pain) and skin cooling. The latter is transduced in the periphery by A delta fibres; sensations of warmth and hot pain, transduced by primary afferent C fibres, are much less significantly affected. Our findings thus fail to resolve the question as to whether chronic clinical pain is mainly an A delta- or a C fibre-mediated phenomenon. ","labels_t":"digestive system diseases"}
{"text":"Racial and ethnic modifiers of the salt-blood pressure response. The relation between sodium and blood pressure is a centuries-old question. A substantial body of epidemiological and experimental data has accumulated that strongly implicates NaCl as having a causal role in the genesis of arterial hypertension. Prospective studies that have been performed in diverse populations that have manipulated NaCl exposure by diet or infusion have repeatedly documented an NaCl pressor effect. Further, similar studies in biracial populations have also demonstrated a greater prevalence of \"salt sensitivity\" in blacks compared with whites. The reasons for this observation are not entirely clear; however, intrinsic or hypertension-induced renal abnormalities that limit natriuretic capacity, reduced Na+,K(+)-ATPase pump activity, other membrane ion transport disturbances, differential exposure to psychological stressors, greater insulin resistance, and dietary factors (reduced Ca+ and K+ intake) have all been suggested as possibly playing a role. Salt sensitivity appears to be a widespread phenomenon. However, it is critically important to determine what factors account for racial differences in salt sensitivity. Moreover, the prevalence of salt sensitivity in the general population is unknown. Current definitions of salt sensitivity are varied and unidirectional. In comparison with bidirectional criteria (blood pressure increase with salt loading and blood pressure decrease with salt restriction), they are probably inadequate to identify salt-sensitive individuals who manifest less extreme blood pressure change after dietary sodium or plasma volume manipulations. More sensitive criteria for diagnosing salt sensitivity will facilitate a better understanding of racial and ethnic differences in the prevalence of salt sensitivity.

OBJECTIVE--To study the source of non-outbreak legionnaires' disease, particularly the role of cooling towers, by comparing the locations of patients' homes in relation to the location of cooling towers. DESIGN--Retrospective, descriptive study of a case series of patients with legionnaires' disease ill between 1978 and 1986 and, for comparison, a case series of patients with lung cancer. A prospectively developed register and interview based survey provided data on the location of cooling towers. SETTING--The city of Glasgow. PATIENTS--134 patients aged 14-84 with legionnaires' disease during 1978-86 and 10,159 patients with lung cancer during the same period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--The locations of patients' homes and cooling towers as defined by postcodes, which provided map grid references accurate to 10 m; numbers of expected and observed cases of legionnaires' disease in census enumeration districts; and distance of enumeration districts from the nearest cooling tower as defined by five distance categories. RESULTS--Most cooling towers were in or near the city centre or close to the River Clyde, as were the places of residence of patients with community acquired, non-travel, non-outbreak legionnaires' disease (n = 107). There was an inverse association between the distance of residence from any cooling tower and the risk of infection, the population living within 0.5 km of any tower having a relative risk of infection over three times that of people living more than 1 km away. There was no such association with respect to travel related legionnaires' disease, and for lung cancer the association was weak (relative risk less than or equal to 1.2 in any distance group). CONCLUSION--In Glasgow cooling towers have been a source of infection in two outbreaks of legionnaires' disease and, apparently, a source of non-outbreak infection also. Better maintenance of cooling towers should help prevent non-outbreak cases. This method of inquiry should be applied elsewhere to study the source of this and other environmentally acquired disease.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS--Blood samples were taken immediately before and after six months of oral contraceptive use and one, two, four, six, eight, and 12 weeks after the pill had been stopped. During the six months of oral contraceptive use the plasma concentration of factor X and fibrinogen increased and that of antithrombin III decreased.

Deletion of chromosome 11p13 in humans produces the WAGR syndrome, consisting of aniridia (an absence or malformation of the iris), Wilms tumor (nephroblastoma), genitourinary malformations, and mental retardation. An interspecies backcross between Mus musculus\/domesticus and Mus spretus was made in order to map the homologous chromosomal region in the mouse genome and to define an animal model of this syndrome. Nine evolutionarily conserved DNA clones from proximal human 11p were localized on mouse chromosome 2 near Small-eyes (Sey), a semidominant mutation that is phenotypically similar to aniridia. Analysis of Dickie's Small-eye (SeyDey), a poorly viable allele that has pleiotropic effects, revealed the deletion of three clones, f3, f8, and k13, which encompass the aniridia (AN2) and Wilms tumor susceptibility genes in man. Unlike their human counterparts, SeyDey\/+ mice do not develop nephroblastomas. These findings suggest that the Small-eye defect is genetically equivalent to human aniridia, but that loss of the murine homolog of the Wilms tumor gene is not sufficient for tumor initiation. A comparison among Sey alleles suggests that the AN2 gene product is required for induction of the lens and nasal placodes. ","labels_t":"general pathological conditions"}
{"text":"Comparison of pre- and postoperative conduction patterns in patients surgically cured of atrioventricular node reentrant tachycardia. Patients with atrioventricular (AV) node reentrant tachycardia characteristically have short and constant retrograde His-atrium conduction times (H2A2 intervals) during the introduction of ventricular extrastimuli. It has therefore been suggested that the tachycardia circuit involves retrograde conduction up an accessory pathway located in perinodal tissue. If the mechanism of surgical cure of AV node reentrant tachycardia is interruption of this accessory pathway, postoperative changes in retrograde conduction would be expected. Thirteen patients with drug-refractory AV node reentrant tachycardia underwent surgery. Preoperatively, H2A2 intervals were short and constant. During AV node reentrant tachycardia, earliest atrial activation was seen near the His bundle and was 0 to 25 ms before ventricular activation in all patients except one. Surgery consisted of dissection of right atrial septal and anterior inputs to the AV node and central fibrous body. Postoperatively, the H2A2 interval remained short and constant compared with preoperative values although it was slightly prolonged (74 +\/- 18 versus 61 +\/- 21 ms, p less than 0.005). Twelve of the 13 patients are free of tachycardia after 28 +\/- 13 months and no patient has had evidence of AV node block. Thus, surgical cure of AV node reentrant tachycardia is highly successful; however, there is no reason to postulate an accessory pathway or use of perinodal tissue as part of the tachycardia circuit and the mechanism of surgical success remains obscure.

{"text":"Improved scintigraphic assessment of severe cholestasis with the hepatic extraction fraction. In previous studies, we found that biliary scintigraphy with technetium-99m-labeled iminodiacetic acid ([99mTc]IDA) provided excellent discrimination between intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholestasis, except in patients with profound cholestasis who had poor visualization of the biliary tree. In this study, we have used deconvolution analysis to determine the hepatic extraction fraction (HEF) of a hypothetical single circulatory pass of [99mTc]IDA. Our hypothesis was that extraction of radionuclide from the blood would be normal in patients with extrahepatic obstruction alone, but would be impaired in patients with intrahepatic disease (IHD). The purpose of this study was to compare the HEF in patients with profound cholestasis (bilirubin greater than or equal to 3.0 mg\/dl) due to either IHD or common bile duct obstruction (CBDO). Normal subjects (N = 13) had an HEF of 100%. Patients with CBDO (N = 13) had slightly reduced HEF values (92.8 +\/- 3.2%) despite profound hyperbilirubinemia (6.1 +\/- 1.0 mg\/dl). Patients with IHD (N = 23) had a markedly reduced HEF (43.1 +\/- 4.1%) which was significantly lower than patients with CBDO and normal subjects (P less than 0.001).

The effects of rTNF-alpha on cell proliferation, DNA synthesis, cell viability, cloning efficiency, cell division, cell morphology, and the immunophenotype were studied in triplicate experiments. The cell line StML-14(3) revealed a significantly dose-dependent reduction of growth due to both cytostatic and cytotoxic activities of rTNF-alpha as well as a decrease of CE. Increased numbers of cells in prophase were observed 24 h after addition of r-TNF-alpha. In addition, dislocation of chromosomes in the metaphase, formation of micronuclei, and dose-dependent increases of cells exhibiting micronuclei and the DNA amount per cell were detected at the end of treatment. On the other hand, only a slight sensitivity to the anti-proliferative effect of rTNF-alpha was observed with StML-14(25) and SKMel-28, whereas StML-12 and StML-11 were significantly resistant. The last four cell lines were serially subcultivated and presented common phenotypic patterns with more malignant characteristics than the cell line StML-14(3) before treatment. Overall, rTNF-alpha enhanced the malignant immunophenotype of the cell lines tested. It increased the expression of the \"late\" melanoma progression markers A.10.33 and A.1.43, and Ki67, and it decreased the expression of the \"early\" progression marker K.1.2. The expression of HLA-I, HLA-DR, and ICAM-1 was also enhanced after rTNF-alpha treatment, whereas in contrast to other cytokines, rTNF-alpha did not induce the de novo expression of HLA-DR in HLA-DR-negative melanoma cell lines. These findings indicate that rTNF-alpha induces cytostasis and decreases cell viability of certain rTNF-alpha-sensitive melanoma cells. These effects may result in selection of rTNF-alpha-non-sensitive human melanoma cell populations with higher proliferation rates and a more aggressive immunophenotype in vitro.

Over the past 8 years we have evaluated 10 cases of such refractory parastomal ulcers that occurred at a mean of 11 years after stomal surgery. Eight patients had had an ileostomy for IBD while two had undergone colostomy for colon cancer. Five patients with IBD were diagnosed as having pyoderma gangrenosum ulcerations. They required systemic treatment for a mean of 25 weeks to effect ulcer healing. The other five patients had either parastomal ulcers on the basis of dermatoses (contact dermatitis, eczema, or bullous pemphigoid) or contact ulcers due to face-plate pressure and parastomal dermatitis. These patients received topical treatment with healing of ulcers in a mean of 4 weeks. We conclude that parastomal ulcers occurring in patients without IBD or IBD patients without classic pyoderma gangrenosum require early dermatologic evaluation as they respond relatively quickly to appropriate local therapy.

Expression of the human placental form of glutathion S-transferase (GST-pi) in human gliomas was investigated by immunohistochemical methods, and the result was compared with that of normal human glial cells. The gliomas in this study were composed of five benign astrocytomas (Grade 2), ten anaplastic astrocytomas (Grade 3), and 16 glioblastomas (Grade 4). Normal human glial cells showed only a weak immunostaining response for GST-pi in the cytoplasm or some nuclear membranes. All of benign astrocytomas had diffusely weak GST-pi immunostaining, resembling that of normal glial cells. With increasing grade, gliomas showed a strongly positive reaction for GST-pi. The positive reactions were remarkable especially in the gemistocytes and giant cells in the high-grade gliomas. These results suggest that cells of gliomas have some detoxifying function and the expression of this detoxifying enzyme, GST-pi, is related to the degree of malignancy of the gliomas.

We studied 251 patients less than or equal to 65 years of age admitted for treatment of symptomatic supraventricular tachyarrhythmia to assess whether these arrhythmias begin evenly throughout the day or manifest circadian variation in occurrence. The arrhythmias included 152 episodes of atrial fibrillation, 50 episodes of supraventricular reentry tachycardia, 30 episodes of atrial flutter, and 19 cases of ectopic atrial tachycardia. A total of 209 patients could tell the exact time their symptoms had started. In 38 of them (18%), the arrhythmia had begun between midnight and 6:00 AM, in 63 (30%) between 6:01 AM and noon, in 46 (22%) between noon and 6:00 PM, and in 62 (30%) between 6:01 PM and midnight. This distribution differed significantly from uniform occurrence (chi square 8.7, p less than 0.05). Fifty patients were using beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents when the arrhythmia occurred. Compared with the other 159 patients, they had no morning surge of arrhythmias (20% versus 33.3% of episodes between 6:01 AM and noon), but instead a much higher incidence at night (34% versus 13.2% of episodes between midnight and 6:00 AM) (chi square 14.4, p less than 0.005). We conclude that the frequency of onset of sustained supraventricular tachyarrhythmias varies with the time of day, showing nearly equal peaks in the morning and in the evening and a trough at night.

Immunostaining demonstrates that the mutant p53 protein is in the nucleus of the arrested cells at 32 degrees C but in the cytoplasm of the growing cells at 37 degrees C. This is the first example of a protein which is temperature-sensitive for nuclear transport. The translocation from cytoplasm to nucleus and vice versa occurs 6 h after temperature shift and is coincident with the inhibition of DNA synthesis; transport from cytoplasm to nucleus does not require protein synthesis. Remarkably, inhibition of protein synthesis at 37 degrees C also results in the rapid appearance of mutant p53 in the cell nucleus. These results suggest the presence of a short-lived protein responsible for holding p53 in the cytoplasm at 37 degrees C but not at 32 degrees C.

The results of the present study showed that neither laparotomy, hypothermia nor insertion of the portosystemic bypass seemed markedly to affect the coagulation profile, but autograft associated with 30 to 45 minutes of warm ischemia resulted in a twofold prolongation of the t1\/2 heparin as calculated from sequential measurements of the activated clotting time. Unexpectedly, the storage of livers for four hours in EuroCollins solutions seemed to result in more rapid disappearance of heparin than in animals after laparotomy. After hepatectomy, the clearance of heparin was delayed for two hours but, thereafter, the slope of the disappearance resembled that in sham operated animals. Autograft and allograft of livers in normal pigs that did not receive transfusion were also associated with changes in fibrinolysis and declining levels of fibrinogen together with severe intraoperative bleeding problems and rapid death on the operating table in 30 per cent of the pigs.

To test the effect of endogenous mediators from dying tissue on vascular leakage, the authors devised an experimental model simulating an infarct, whereby living vessels would be exposed to fragments of organs undergoing aseptic necrosis. Tissues from donor rats were implanted aseptically in the cremasteric sac. Control rats were implanted with materials deemed to be as close as possible to nonirritating: boiled tissues and spheres of Teflon or glass. At different points the rats were injected intravenously with carbon black and killed an hour later. Whole cremaster mounts showed that vascular labeling was strictly venular up to 8 hours, mixed with capillary labeling between 12 and 24 hours, and mainly or exclusively capillary at 48 hours. Histology showed an acute inflammatory infiltrate in the labeled areas. A similar but weaker labeling pattern accompanied by milder inflammation was seen in controls.

Blockade of one of these mechanisms may lead to compensatory stimulation of the others, thus offsetting in part the hemodynamic benefits of a specific intervention. Combination therapy, designed to attack all three systems (with use of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, a sympathetic blocker such as clonidine, and an antagonist of the vasopressor action of vasopressin), may help in the treatment of such cases.

The relative relapse risk in follicular thyroid cancer (RR) was 6.8-fold increased in the presence of a moderate when compared with a high degree of histologic tumor differentiation. The RR rose with increasing age of the patient at time of tumor diagnosis by a factor of 1.8 per 20 years. The RR was reduced by a factor of 4.3 after the performance of a neck dissection and by a factor of 2.3 after percutaneous radiation therapy of the neck. The relative mortality risk in follicular thyroid cancer (RM) rose in the absence of a tumor capsule by a factor of 10, in the presence of a moderate compared with a high degree of histologic tumor differentiation by a factor of 5.9, in the presence of distant metastases by a factor of 3.2, and with increasing age of the patient at the time of tumor diagnosis by a factor of 2.2 per 20 years. From these data prognostic indices denoting the individual risk for tumor relapse (IRR index) and tumor mortality (IMR index) were calculated. The indices categorize patients into low-risk, medium-risk, or high-risk groups with regard to tumor relapse and tumor-related death. Consequently, the IRR and IMR indices contribute to select patients with follicular thyroid cancer who need an aggressive form of treatment and an intensive follow-up program.

Erythropoietin triggers the differentiation of erythrocyte progenitors by binding to receptors on their plasma membrane. We report here that pretreatment of erythropoietin-responsive murine erythroleukemia cells with chemical inducers resulted in a striking increase in erythropoietin-specific hemoglobinization. This amplification of the erythropoietin biologic response was accompanied by the induction of a new population of high-density receptors (approximately 20,000 per cell) exhibiting marked positive cooperativity. Erythropoietin binding to new receptors displayed a convex upward Scatchard plot and a Hill coefficient (nH) of 6.75. Measurement of erythropoietin receptor mRNA demonstrated an initial decrease in receptor transcript followed by an approximately 2- to 3-fold increase after 24-48 hr. This increase in receptor message does not appear to account for the magnitude of the receptor up-regulation by dimethyl sulfoxide. We propose that this positive cooperativity reflects the interaction (clustering) of receptors, presumably through the formation of homooligomers or heterooligomers, and that this receptor interaction may amplify the erythropoietin signal transduction pathway.

Lack of benefit from nimodipine treatment after the insult may occur because the inexorable progression of events leading to ischemic neuronal damage, once initiated, cannot be arrested. On the other hand, pharmacokinetic factors may be important, and post-treatment efficacy may depend on administration protocols that achieve an adequate concentration in ischemic tissue sufficiently soon after an insult. Our findings are compatible with the benefit of nimodipine being due to an improvement in blood flow that reduces the severity of ischemia.

{"text":"Renal artery stenosis in patients with aortic dissection: increased prevalence The authors retrospectively analyzed the prevalence of renal artery stenosis in 63 consecutive patients with aortic dissection who underwent thoracic and abdominal aortography. Ten patients (16%) had renal artery stenosis, five with atherosclerosis and five with fibromuscular lesions. Risk factors for aortic dissection were Marfan disease in nine patients, bicuspid aortic valve in one, and hypertension in 54 (including seven patients with Marfan syndrome). If the patients with Marfan syndrome and the patient with the bicuspid aortic valve are excluded, renal artery stenosis was present in 10 of 53 patients (19%) when the cause of dissection was presumably hypertension. This finding suggests that renovascular hypertension is a greater risk factor for aortic dissection than is essential hypertension. The success of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) in controlling renovascular hypertension has been proved. In this series, emergent PTRA successfully controlled the hypertension in one patient with a type B dissection, resulting in an excellent clinical outcome. Angiography should be routinely performed on patients with aortic dissections to evaluate for renal artery stenosis. ","labels_t":"nervous system diseases"}
{"text":"Reduction of post-traumatic swelling and compartment pressure by impulse compression of the foot. Following the discovery of a powerful venous pump in the foot that is activated by weight-bearing independently of muscular action, a pneumatic impulse device was developed to actuate this pump artificially. In a multicentre international trial the device was shown to reduce post-traumatic and postoperative swelling; pain also was alleviated. Evidence is also presented that dangerously high compartment pressures may be reduced to acceptable levels and fasciotomy avoided. We present an explanation of the clinical effects of activation of the venous footpump, based on recent improved understanding of the physiology of the microcirculation. The hyperaemic response that follows the liberation of endothelial-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) by sudden changes of pressure after weight-bearing or impulse compression is particularly important.

Reduction of cardiac mortality associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair remains an important goal. Five hundred consecutive urgent or elective operations for infrarenal nonruptured AAA were reviewed. Patients were divided into three groups based on preoperative cardiac status: group I (n = 260, 52%), no clinical or electrocardiographic (ECG) evidence of coronary artery disease (CAD); group II (n = 212, 42.2%), clinical or ECG evidence of CAD considered stable after further evaluation with studies such as dipyridamole-thallium scanning, echocardiography, or coronary arteriography; group III (n = 28, 5.6%), clinical or ECG evidence of CAD considered unstable after further evaluation. Group I had no further cardiac evaluation and groups I and II underwent AAA repair without invasive treatment of CAD. Group III underwent repair of cardiac disease before (n = 21) or coincident with (n = 7) AAA repair. In all instances, perioperative fluid volume management was based on left ventricular performance curves constructed before operation. The 30-day operative mortality rate for AAA repair in all 500 patients was 1.6% (n = 8). There was one (0.4%) cardiac-related operative death in group I, which was significantly less than the five (2.4%) in group II (p less than 0.02). Total mortality for the two groups were also significantly different, with one group I death (0.4%) and seven group II deaths (3.3%), (p less than 0.02). These data support the conclusions that (1) the leading cause of perioperative mortality in AAA repair is myocardial infarction, (2) correction of severe or unstable CAD before or coincident with AAA repair is effective in preventing operative mortality, (3) patients with known CAD should be investigated more thoroughly to identify those likely to develop perioperative myocardial ischemia so that their CAD can be corrected before AAA repair, and (4) patients with no clinical or ECG evidence of CAD rarely die of perioperative myocardial infarction, and thus selective evaluation of CAD based on clinical grounds in AAA patients is justified.

It is not known, however, if TCR peptides can treat established disease. To test its therapeutic value, TCR-V beta 8-39-59 peptide was injected into rats with clinical signs of EAE. This treatment reduced disease severity and speeded recovery, apparently by boosting anti-V beta 8 T cells and antibodies raised naturally in response to encephalitogenic V beta 8+ T cells. These results demonstrate that synthetic TCR peptides can be used therapeutically, and implicate the TCR-V beta 8-39-59 sequence as a natural idiotope involved in EAE recovery.

This study focused on the patients with LNUP. Only 86 patients were treated with surgery (plus radiotherapy).

{"text":"Recurrent cyanotic episodes with severe arterial hypoxaemia and intrapulmonary shunting: a mechanism for sudden death The pathophysiology of recurrent cyanotic episodes has been investigated in 51 infants and children. Episodes began at a median age of 7 weeks (range 1 day to 22 months, 39 at less than 4 months). They were characterised by the rapidity of onset and progression of severe hypoxaemia with early loss of consciousness from cerebral hypoxia. The most common precipitating factor was a sudden naturally occurring stimulus from pain, fear, or anger. In uncontrolled trials, cyanotic episodes were reduced in frequency and severity by tetrabenazine (n = 15) and additional inspired oxygen (n = 10). Eight patients died suddenly and unexpectedly (four during cyanotic episodes). Twenty eight patients underwent physiological studies during cyanotic episodes. There was no evidence of seizure activity at the onset and although prolonged absence of inspiratory effort with continued expiratory efforts was common, breathing sometimes continued. Episodes were not caused by upper airway obstruction and sometimes occurred during positive airway pressure ventilation. The rapidity of fall in arterial oxygen pressure and continued breathing suggested a right to left shunt of sudden onset. The results of contrast echocardiography and lung imaging studies confirmed that this was occurring within the lungs. These cyanotic episodes included both intrapulmonary shunting and prolonged expiratory apnoea. They are best explained by interactions between central sympathetic activity, brainstem control of respiration and vasomotor activity, reflexes arising from around and within the respiratory tract, and the matching of ventilation to perfusion in the lungs. They are a cause of sudden unexpected death in infancy and early childhood. ","labels_t":"general pathological conditions"}

To assess their potential oncogenic role, normal bone marrow cells were infected with retroviruses bearing the genes for IL-3 or IL-3 plus Hox-2.4. Unlike the IL-3 virus, the IL-3\/Hox-2.4 virus was highly leukemogenic. Infected cells expressing both genes exhibited retarded differentiation in vitro, generated myelomonocytic cell lines, and provoked a rapid, transplantable myeloid leukemia in vivo. The oncogenic action of Hox-2.4 appears to derive from its ability to impede the IL-3-driven terminal differentiation of myeloid cells. The results suggest that homeobox genes can regulate key differentiation processes such as self-renewal capacity and that their inappropriate expression can be oncogenic.

As part of an interdisciplinary study of medical injury and malpractice litigation, we estimated the incidence of adverse events, defined as injuries caused by medical management, and of the subgroup of such injuries that resulted from negligent or substandard care. METHODS. We reviewed 30,121 randomly selected records from 51 randomly selected acute care, nonpsychiatric hospitals in New York State in 1984. We then developed population estimates of injuries and computed rates according to the age and sex of the patients as well as the specialties of the physicians. RESULTS. Adverse events occurred in 3.7 percent of the hospitalizations (95 percent confidence interval, 3.2 to 4.2), and 27.6 percent of the adverse events were due to negligence (95 percent confidence interval, 22.5 to 32.6). Although 70.5 percent of the adverse events gave rise to disability lasting less than six months, 2.6 percent caused permanently disabling injuries and 13.6 percent led to death. The percentage of adverse events attributable to negligence increased in the categories of more severe injuries (Wald test chi 2 = 21.04, P less than 0.0001). Using weighted totals, we estimated that among the 2,671,863 patients discharged from New York hospitals in 1984 there were 98,609 adverse events and 27,179 adverse events involving negligence. Rates of adverse events rose with age (P less than 0.0001). The percentage of adverse events due to negligence was markedly higher among the elderly (P less than 0.01). There were significant differences in rates of adverse events among categories of clinical specialties (P less than 0.0001), but no differences in the percentage due to negligence. CONCLUSIONS.

One lesson for public policy is that generalizations about the cost-effectiveness of \"prevention\" are unwise.

An important factor in the development of hypotension during hemodialysis (HD) is a decrease in blood volume, due to ultrafiltration (UF) and an insufficient refill of the intravascular compartment. This insufficient refill might be caused by a transcellular fluid shift from the extracellular to the intracellular compartment. We studied the influence of dialysate sodium concentration and UF rate on the refill rate, blood volume, intracellular (ICV) and extracellular fluid volume (ECV). Three different HD strategies were studied in 15 patients: (A) conventional HD (dialysate sodium 140 mmol\/L); (B) HD with a sodium profile (140-148 mmol\/L); and (C) HD with a sodium profile and a variable UF rate (high-low UF rate). ICV and ECV were measured by non-invasive conductivity measurements, blood volume was calculated from erythrocyte counts before and after treatment. Blood volume decrease was most pronounced during conventional HD, due to insufficient refilling without a detectable transcellular fluid shift. The sum of the decrease in ICV and EVC was less than during (B) and (C). The insufficient refill led to a higher prevalence of hypotension and cramps. The strategies (B) and (C) led to an significant and comparable transcellular fluid shift to the extracellular compartment. Thus, the use of a sodium profile led to a better intravascular refill and clinical tolerance of HD. Addition of a UF profile did not improve this any further. ","labels_t":"neoplasms"}

Advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of meningitis have occurred primarily through the use of experimental animal models. These models have proven to be particularly valuable in experimental bacterial meningitis, focusing on the bacterial virulence factors responsible for the initiation of infections, CNS invasion, and induction of SAS inflammation. Recent studies have examined the formation of host inflammatory cytokines in response to these virulence factors. These cytokines may be responsible for many of the pathophysiologic consequences of bacterial meningitis (eg. increased BBB permeability, cerebral edema, and increased intracranial pressure). Meningitis due to C. neoformans occurs most commonly in patients with defects in cell-mediated immunity (eg, AIDS), and the depletion of T helper cells in AIDS patients may allow unrestricted cryptococcal growth. Viral meningitis is an illness of low prevalence when compared with the overall occurrence of viral infections at other sites. CNS infection usually occurs by means of traversal across barriers that normally exclude viral invasion of the CNS, primarily through hematogenous dissemination from initial sites of infection.

A total of 593 men were without risk factors. The study comprised all of the men who did not have an intervention (n = 1203). In 1979, 1120 men were re-examined, and in 1986 945 men attended follow up. There were two groups for analysis: one comprising all subjects and the other comprising only men who were normotensive in 1968 and for whom complete information was available. INTERVENTIONS--By 1979, 103 men were taking antihypertensive drugs, and by 1986, 131 were taking antihypertensive drugs and 12 were taking drugs for hyperglycaemia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Blood glucose concentration one hour after a glucose load, blood pressure, and body weight were measured in 1968, 1974, and 1979. In 1986 blood pressure and body weight were recorded. RESULTS--Men who were hypertensive in 1986 had significantly higher blood pressures (p less than 0.0001) and (after adjustment for body mass index and alcohol intake) significantly higher blood glucose concentrations one hour after a glucose load at all examinations than those who were normotensive in 1986. Regression analysis showed that the higher the blood glucose concentration after a glucose load in 1968 the higher the blood pressure during the following years. Those men between the second and third tertiles of blood glucose concentration in 1968 had a significantly higher risk of developing hypertension (odds ratio 1.71, 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 2.77) compared with those below the first tertile. CONCLUSION--In this study men who developed hypertension tended to have shown an increased intolerance to glucose up to 18 years before the clinical manifestation of their disorder. Blood glucose concentration one hour after a glucose load was an independent predictor of future hypertension. ","labels_t":"nervous system diseases"}

PURPOSE: To describe the results of fludarabine therapy in patients with prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL) and the prolymphocytoid variant of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL-Pro). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventeen patients with a diagnosis of PLL or CLL-Pro received fludarabine 30 mg\/m2 over 30 minutes daily for 5 days every 4 weeks alone (12 patients), or with prednisone (five patients). Previously defined criteria for response were used. Differences in response rates according to various characteristics were evaluated by chi-square test. RESULTS: Three patients (18%) achieved complete remission, and three (18%) had a partial remission, for an overall response rate of 35%. Responses were durable and occurred in all involved organ sites. Lower response rates were observed in patients with anemia, thrombocytopenia, advanced Rai stages, and primary resistance to prior therapy. Toxicities were minimal except for febrile episodes associated with therapy. CONCLUSION: Fludarabine has shown encouraging results in these patients and deserves further investigation in combination with other active agents, and in the setting of front-line therapy.

{"text":"Sudden death in young competitive athletes: clinicopathologic correlations in 22 cases. PURPOSE: To investigate the pathologic substrates of sudden death in young competitive athletes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-two cases of sudden death in young competitive athletes occurring in the Veneto region (northern Italy) in the period January 1979 to December 1989 were studied by postmortem examination. The athletes included 19 males and three females, ranging in age from 11 to 35 years (mean, 23 years). RESULTS: In 18 cases, sudden death occurred during (16 cases) or immediately after (two cases) a competitive sport activity. In 10 subjects, sudden death was apparently the first sign of disease. Postmortem examination disclosed that this fatality was due to arrhythmic cardiac arrest in 17 cases; among these, right ventricular cardiomyopathy, also known as \"right ventricular dysplasia,\" was the most frequently encountered cardiovascular disease (six cases), followed by atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (four cases), conduction system pathology (three cases), anomalous origin of right coronary artery from the wrong aortic sinus (two cases), and mitral valve prolapse (two cases). In two athletes, the abrupt lethal complication was \"mechanical\" and consisted of pulmonary embolism and rupture of the aorta; in three athletes, death was due to a cerebral cause. All athletes with right ventricular cardiomyopathy died during effort, and most had a history of palpitations and\/or syncope. Whenever available, electrocardiographic (ECG) tracings showed inverted T waves in precordial leads and\/or left bundle branch block ventricular arrhythmias. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicopathologic correlations indicate that in the Veneto region of Italy, right ventricular cardiomyopathy is not so rare among the cardiovascular diseases associated with the risk of arrhythmic cardiac arrest, and seems to account for the majority of cases of sudden death in young athletes; this disorder can be suspected during life on the basis of prodromal symptoms and ECG signs.

To determine how closely US pediatricians follow the 1985 American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Nutrition's recommendations on oral therapy for acute diarrhea, a questionnaire was administered to four groups: New England private practitioners, pediatricians from 27 states attending a postgraduate course, representatives of departments of pediatrics at US schools of medicine, and housestaff at Boston Children's and Massachusetts General hospitals. The responses from departments of pediatrics and housestaff were not significantly different from those of community practitioners in most categories. The reported rate of use of glucose-electrolyte solutions recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics was not different from the use of nonphysiologic, high-osmolar, low-salt solutions such as sodas and juices. The usage rate for glucose-electrolyte solutions meeting the American Academy of Pediatrics-recommended carbohydrate-to-sodium ratio of less than 2:1 was less than 30%. Other findings included the general lack of agreement on the use of a single type of therapy and the common use of oral therapy only for mild or no dehydration. Although the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that feeding be reintroduced in the first 24 hours of a diarrheal episode, the majority of respondents withhold feeding until the second day or later.

Serum bromide concentrations, using a gold chloride assay technique, were monitored at that time, and at four- and six-week intervals thereafter. Serum bromide concentrations demonstrated a four-fold change during this period ranging from peak levels of 2.2 mEq.L-1 (176 micrograms.kg-1) during the fifth week of treatment decreasing to less than 0.5 mEq.L-1 (less than 40 micrograms.ml-1) six weeks following the end of treatments.

The patients with high blood pressure were younger (65 vs. 73 years) and much more often had a history of hypertension (78 vs. 42%). Cardiac and vascular hypertensive manifestations were more frequent, particularly when only those patients with a history of hypertension were compared in the two groups. Alcohol abuse was mentioned in a higher proportion of hypertensives in the summaries of their medical records. No definite conclusions could be drawn with regard to the size and location of the brain lesions. Clinical symptoms did not differ between the groups, neither did the proportion of patients who could be discharged from hospital immediately. Mortality was higher in the high blood pressure group (30 vs. 14%, P less than 0.05). Thus the characteristics of patients with very high blood pressure were: younger age, much more frequent and severe previous hypertension. Alcohol abuse might be an important factor. The type, size and location of the brain lesion itself could not be statistically related to the high blood pressure, but very large lesions, particularly haemorrhages, might be associated with a reactive blood pressure response.

{"text":"Effect of tamoxifen on serum insulinlike growth factor I levels in stage I breast cancer patients. Insulinlike growth factor I (IGF-I) has been shown to be a potent mitogen for breast cancer cells in vitro, and IGF-I receptors have been demonstrated on human primary breast neoplasms. In a randomized, placebo-controlled study, we document that administration of the antiestrogen tamoxifen to patients with breast cancer was associated with a statistically significant (P = .002) reduction in the serum level of IGF-I. The mean IGF-I level was 1.4 U\/mL in the placebo-treated group and 0.9 U\/mL in the tamoxifen-treated group. Because serum IGF-I level is growth hormone (GH) dependent and because data suggest that the pubertal surge in GH and IGF-I levels is sex steroid dependent, we speculate that the mechanism underlying our observation may involve blockade by tamoxifen of estrogen action in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. We conclude that tamoxifen treatment reduces IGF-I levels and that this reduction may contribute to the therapeutic effect of the drug. ","labels_t":"digestive system diseases"}

This study examined the effects of discontinuation of neuroleptic treatment on plasma homovanillic acid levels in 23 patients with chronic schizophrenia. It was hypothesized that clinical decompensation would be associated with increased plasma homovanillic acid levels. Plasma homovanillic acid was measured during administration of neuroleptic medication and during a subsequent 6-week drug-free period. Nine patients decompensated during the drug-free period and 14 patients did not. Following drug discontinuation, plasma homovanillic acid concentrations were higher in schizophrenic patients who decompensated than in those who did not. Furthermore, peak plasma homovanillic acid elevation after discontinuation of neuroleptic medication was significantly correlated with peak Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale increase. The data suggest that, in some schizophrenic patients, symptomatic decompensation after discontinuation of neuroleptic treatment is associated with increases in dopamine turnover.

{"text":"An epidemiologic study of abuse of analgesic drugs. Effects of phenacetin and salicylate on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity (1968 to 1987) BACKGROUND. Phenacetin abuse is known to produce kidney disease; salicylate use is supposed to prevent cardiovascular disease. We conducted a prospective, longitudinal epidemiologic study to examine the effects of these drugs on cause-specific mortality and on cardiovascular morbidity. METHODS. In 1968 we evaluated a study group of 623 healthy women 30 to 49 years old who had evidence of a regular intake of phenacetin, as measured by urinary excretion of its metabolites, and a matched control group of 621 women. Salicylate excretion was also measured. All subjects were examined over a period of 20 years. RESULTS. Life-table analyses of mortality during the 20 years, with adjustment for the year of birth, cigarette smoking, and length of follow-up, revealed significant differences between the groups in overall mortality (study group vs. control group, 74 vs. 27 deaths; relative risk, 2.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 3.3), deaths due to urologic or renal disease (relative risk, 16.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 3.9 to 66.1), deaths due to cancer (relative risk, 1.9; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 3.3), and deaths due to cardiovascular disease (relative risk, 2.9; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 5.5). The relative risk of cardiovascular disease (fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, heart failure, or stroke) was 1.8, and the 95 percent confidence interval 1.3 to 2.6. The odds ratio for the incidence of hypertension was 1.6, and the 95 percent confidence interval 1.2 to 2.1. The effects of phenacetin on morbidity and mortality, with adjustment for base-line salicylate excretion, were similar. In contrast, salicylate use had no effect on either mortality or morbidity. CONCLUSIONS. Regular use of analgesic drugs containing phenacetin is associated with an increased risk of hypertension and mortality and morbidity due to cardiovascular disease, as well as an increased risk of mortality due to cancer and urologic or renal disease. The use of salicylates carries no such risk. ","labels_t":"nervous system diseases"}

Photodynamic therapy is a promising treatment for human brain tumors because of the selective retention of certain compounds by tumor cells. Certain lipophilic cationic compounds, such as tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP), are selectively taken up by a variety of carcinomas. Although preferential retention of TPP has been demonstrated for the breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7, this compound had not been tested previously on cells derived from nervous system tumors. In the present study, tritiated-TPP (3H-TPP) uptake and retention for eight different cell cultures of three histologically different types of nervous system tumors was measured and the data were compared to a positive control (MCF-7) and negative controls (normal African Green monkey kidney epithelium (CV-1) and the normal human fibroblast (WI-38) cell lines). Uptake and retention characteristics could be grouped by specific pathological tumor types, but individual tumor variability was notable. Malignant astrocytoma (grade III\/III glioblastoma) and malignant neurofibrosarcoma cells showed preferential uptake and retention of 3H-TPP relative to meningioma cells and normal controls. A clonogenic assay utilizing the cytotoxic lipophilic cationic compound dequalinium showed strong retainers of 3H-TPP to be more susceptible to the effects of dequalinium than weak retainers. These data demonstrate that certain human and experimental animal nervous system tumor cell lines retain lipophilic compounds possessing a delocalized positive charge.

{"text":"Systems analysis of cerebrovascular pressure transmission: an observational study in head-injured patients. In an observational study in head-injured patients, cerebrovascular pressure transmission was investigated using a systems analysis approach whereby the blood pressure (BP) waveform was used as a measure of an input stimulus to the cerebrovascular bed (CVB) and the intracranial pressure (ICP) waveform as the response to that stimulus. The transfer function is a measure of how much pressure is transmitted through the CVB at a given frequency and is calculated using Fourier analysis of the pressure waveforms. The transfer function allows quantification of the pressure transmission performance of the CVB, thus providing a basis for comparison between normal and abnormal function. Fifteen hundred samples of ICP and BP waveforms were collected from 30 head-injured patients via microcomputer. Off-line spectral analysis of the waveform database revealed four main classes of transfer function: those with an overall flat transfer function (curve type 1); those with an elevated low-frequency response (curve type 2); those with an elevated high-frequency response (curve type 3); and those exhibiting both an elevated low- and high-frequency response (curve type 4). Curve types 2 and 4 were most often associated with raised ICP (greater than 20 mm Hg), whereas curve types 1 and 3 were most often affiliated with ICP less than 15 mm Hg. Studies of this type may provide insight into the pathophysiology of the CVB and ultimately aid in the prediction and treatment of raised ICP. ","labels_t":"neoplasms"}

Staging systems for breast cancer, unlike those of neoplasms in distant or recessed sites, allowed for the early development of clinical staging evaluation. It was established that clinical assessment of the breast lesion was often wrong compared with the pathologic examination (benign vs. malignant); clinical measurement of the tumor in centimeters was often larger than histologic size; and clinical assessment of axillary nodes (clear or metastatic) was incorrect in about 30% of cases. Although both clinical and pathologic staging provide effective discriminants for prognosis of treated patients, prognosis is more accurately determined by the pathologic stage. The single most important prognostic indicator is the axillary nodal status, and when positive, the number of positive nodes. The American Joint Committee on Cancer and the Union International Contra Cancer have agreed on a TNM staging for breast carcinoma, and this is the preferable staging system. Follow-up of treated patients is of most value in detecting local recurrence on the chest wall (after mastectomy) or in the irradiated breast (after lumpectomy), and also in early detection of contralateral breast cancer.

The relative merits of these stent arrangements are discussed, and a new technique for placing the stents in a T configuration is described. ","labels_t":"cardiovascular diseases"}
{"text":"Deficiencies of coagulation-inhibiting and fibrinolytic proteins in outpatients with deep-vein thrombosis BACKGROUND. Isolated deficiencies of antithrombin III, protein C, protein S, and plasminogen have been implicated as a cause of deep-vein thrombosis. It is assumed that patients with recurrent, familial, or juvenile thrombosis are very likely to have such a deficiency. METHODS. We studied the prevalence of isolated deficiencies of these proteins in 277 consecutive outpatients with venographically proved acute deep-vein thrombosis, as compared with 138 age-matched and sex-matched controls without deep-vein thrombosis, and calculated the positive predictive value of a history of recurrent, familial, or juvenile venous thromboembolism for the presence of such a deficiency. RESULTS. The overall prevalence of deficiencies of any of these proteins in the patients with venous thrombosis was 8.3 percent (23 of 277 patients) (95 percent confidence interval, 5.4 to 12.4), as compared with 2.2 percent in the controls (3 of 138 subjects) (95 percent confidence interval, 0.5 to 6.1; P less than 0.05 for the comparison between groups). The positive predictive values for the presence of an isolated protein deficiency in patients with recurrent, familial, or juvenile deep-vein thrombosis, defined as the proportion of patients with the clinical finding who had a deficiency of one or more of the proteins, were 9, 16, and 12 percent, respectively. CONCLUSIONS. The cause of acute venous thrombosis in most outpatients (91.7 percent) cannot be explained by abnormalities of coagulation-inhibiting and fibrinolytic proteins. The information obtained from the medical history concerning recurrent or familial venous thrombosis or the onset of the disease at a young age is not useful for the identification of patients with protein deficiencies.

{"text":"Power of oesophageal peristalsis can be controlled voluntarily. The hypothesis that oesophageal peristalsis can be modified voluntarily was explored. Six healthy male volunteers and eight female patients with angina like chest pain underwent oesophageal manometry. Each was asked to take a series of swallows, and to vary their size, in random order, by taking either a big gulp or a little swallow. None of the subjects experienced difficulty in doing so. In both groups the amplitude of oesophageal contractions were significantly greater after big gulps than little swallows (p less than 0.01) and this was true for wet (82.0 v 68.9 mmHg) and dry swallows (52.3 v 43.3 mmHg). For the patients' wet swallows the mean values were 73.0 and 56.0 mmHg. Thus, the amplitude of oesophageal peristalsis can be controlled voluntarily. This effect may account for some of the within subject variation in the amplitude of oesophageal contractions. During oesophageal manometry subjects should be encouraged to standardise the size of their swallows whenever possible. Patients with symptoms related to abnormal oesophageal peristalsis such as dysphagia, heartburn, and chest pain may benefit from biofeedback training. ","labels_t":"nervous system diseases"}

Patients in all three groups who bled were treated with emergency endoscopy and sclerotherapy. Stratification according to presence of ascites was also undertaken. Median follow-up was 61 mo (range = 14 to 107 mo). Survival among unrandomized patients was significantly longer than among randomized patients (p less than 0.006), but there was no significant difference between those treated by sclerotherapy and the controls (p = 0.27). Alcoholic cirrhotic patients undergoing sclerotherapy had better 2-yr survival than did the controls (80% vs. 43%; p = 0.09), but this benefit was not sustained at 5 yr. Survival in the nonalcoholic patient groups was identical. Only 10 of 50 deaths were caused by variceal bleeding. Forty-eight percent of patients with large varices bled, compared with 20% of patients with small varices. Wedged hepatic vein pressure less than 12 mm Hg accurately identified alcoholic patients at low risk of variceal bleeding but not nonalcoholic patients. Only four episodes of variceal bleeding were attributable to elective sclerotherapy. We conclude that in our population, prophylactic sclerotherapy alone does not improve survival. The discrepancy in survival between alcoholic and nonalcoholic cirrhotic patients suggests that factors other than variceal hemorrhage may be responsible for the difference.

{"text":"Indapamide: a diuretic of choice for the treatment of hypertension? In recent years, the therapeutic approach to mild hypertension has evolved from a stepped care approach to one including varied, initial monotherapies, with the selection of drug based on factors present in an individual patient, followed by combination therapy. The greatest cumulative experience of the value of antihypertensive therapy has been obtained with diuretics. The reduction in risk of cardiovascular disease with successful antihypertensive therapy using conventional agents, including diuretics, is not as great as might have been anticipated by the magnitude of change in blood pressure. This could be due to antecedent cardiovascular injury prior to therapy or to risk factors induced by therapy. The recent introduction of a new generation of drugs with combined diuretic and hypotensive effects that reduce blood pressure without inducing the biochemical changes associated with thiazides, offers an opportunity to evaluate this question. Indapamide is the first of this new generation to be released. Its pharmacologic characteristics show that it has the prerequisites to be considered a first-line drug for use in hypertension. It meets the requirements of a Phase II or second generation drug in that it has similar efficacy, but less short term toxicity than first generation drugs. It has been introduced at a cost that is competitive with thiazides and potassium-sparing combination drugs and is cheaper than many other classes of antihypertensive drugs. The major caution in promoting its use is that its long term effect on morbidity and mortality in hypertensive disease has not yet been evaluated. In summary, this is a promising new drug that has the potential to replace first generation thiazides in the routine management of hypertension. ","labels_t":"nervous system diseases"}

Although most patients with hydrocephalus are treated effectively with ventriculoperitoneal shunts, a small group fails to respond to diversion procedures. In some patients within this group, hydrocephalus may be caused in part by the overproduction of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In other patients, previous shunt infections may limit the ability of the peritoneum to absorb fluid, and patient response to a ventriculoperitoneal shunt may be improved by reducing CSF production. We discuss a case of a 29-month-old hydrocephalic infant with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt who had ascites. Computed tomography showed bilateral symmetrical enlargement of the choroid plexus. Repeated cultures of the CSF and shunt tubing were sterile, and the daily production of the CSF exceeded 1000 ml. Therapy with acetazolamide decreased the CSF output temporarily, but it was discontinued after serious electrolyte abnormalities occurred. The endoscopic coagulation of the choroid plexus with a neodymium:YAG laser transmitted through a flexible quartz fiber decreased CSF production effectively.

They examined serum concentrations of individual complement proteins and phenotypes for C3, C4A, C4B, and factor B (Bf) for related and unrelated patients with IgA nephropathy from Kentucky and for patients from the Mid-South region of Tennessee, Mississippi, and Alabama. In these populations, they have described partial complement deficiencies or specific phenotypes which may be associated with the disease. Their findings include the following: (1) partial deficiencies for C2, beta 1H (H), properdin (P), or C4 binding protein (C4BP) in four patients with end-stage renal disease, (2) an association between the C3*F allele with IgA nephropathy in the combined group of unrelated patients from Kentucky and the Mid-South, (3) the occurrence of C4B deficiency in two siblings with IgA nephropathy, and (4) an association between C4A deficiency and poor outcome in patients with IgA nephropathy diagnosed as adults. In addition, the related patients differ from the unrelated patients from Kentucky with respect to frequencies of Bf*F and the BfF (FF + FS + F1F + F1S) phenotype, suggestive of immunogenetic difference between these groups.

Group A was characterized by a marked reduction of muscular activity during emptying and a pronounced closing reflex after emptying. This was followed by return of normal tonic activity. Patients in group B had no relaxation of the sphincters during emptying but a pronounced increased activity in the external sphincter and the puborectalis muscle. They also had severe emptying difficulties at defecography. No closing reflex was seen. In group C the electrical activity in the sphincters increased during moderate straining and when emptying was complete a clear closing reflex was seen.

{"text":"Hormonal dependency of cerebral meningiomas. Part 2: In vitro effect of steroids, bromocriptine, and epidermal growth factor on growth of meningiomas. Cell culture and biochemical techniques have been employed to examine the effects of steroids, bromocriptine, and epidermal growth factor (EGF) on the growth and proliferative potential of meningiomas. In cell culture, the growth of meningiomas was not altered by progestogens, antiprogestogens, or 17beta-estradiol. The progestogen, norethisterone, had no effect on the uptake by meningiomas cell cultures of 3H-thymidine. Furthermore, cytosolic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerase activity of meningiomas did not correlate with the progesterone receptor status of the same tumors. In contrast, the androgen antagonists, cyproterone acetate and 11-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, and the dopamine agonist, bromocriptine, all inhibited the in vitro growth of meningioma cells. The growth of meningioma cell cultures was stimulated by EGF, and there was a positive correlation between the EGF content and DNA polymerase activity in meningioma cytosols. These results demonstrate that female sex steroids do not influence growth of meningiomas in vitro, whereas antiandrogens and bromocriptine have an antiproliferative effect. Consequently, bromocriptine and antiandrogens may have a role in the medical treatment of meningiomas. In addition, these results suggest that EGF may be involved in the genesis and\/or progression of meningiomas. ","labels_t":"neoplasms"}
{"text":"Evaluation of metastatic cardiac calcification in a model of chronic primary hyperparathyroidism. Recent reports have fueled an interest in the prevalence and significance of metastatic calcium deposition in patients with chronic hyperparathyroidism. Experimental data are limited by the lack of suitable in vivo animal models. We have developed a model of marked hypercalcemia and overproduction of parathyroid hormone using somatic gene transfer. Briefly, the process involves infection of cultured rodent fibroblasts (RAT-1 cells) with a retroviral expression vector that contains the gene encoding human parathyroid hormone. Fibroblasts are grown to confluence on collagen-coated dextran microcarrier beads and are injected into the peritoneal cavities of syngeneic Fisher rats. Human parathyroid hormone production in rat serum is quantified by an immunoradiometric assay for human parathyroid hormone (1-84), which does not recognize rat parathyroid hormone. These rats consistently show production of human hormone within a week. Levels increase progressively, often to 1 ng\/ml within 60 days of injection. Serum calcium showed a concomitant rise to an average of 15.5 mg\/dl. In this study, 13 rats that had been transplanted with parathyroid hormone-producing fibroblasts were killed 80 days after injection. Examination of the skeleton revealed demineralization and histopathologic sequelae of parathyroid hormone excess with extensive osteoclastic bone resorption. Examination of the hearts revealed calcification in five of 13 hearts. There was no involvement of major coronary arteries or conducting systems, but there was calcification of cardiac myocytes, primarily in subepicardial region.

Beginning with commercial availability in July 1986, this study sought additional, voluntarily reported clinical data pertaining to treatment through a 3 week follow-up. The study included 717 adults who received Digoxin Immune Fab (Ovine). Most patients were greater than or equal to 70 years old and developed toxicity during maintenance dosing with digoxin. Fifty percent of patients were reported to have a complete response to treatment, 24% a partial response and 12% no response.

In the treatment of gallstones with extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy, the bile acid ursodiol is administered to dissolve the gallstone fragments. We designed our study to determine the value of administering this agent. METHODS. At 10 centers, 600 symptomatic patients with three or fewer radiolucent gallstones 5 to 30 mm in diameter, as visualized by oral cholecystography, were randomly assigned to receive ursodiol or placebo for six months, starting one week before lithotripsy. RESULTS. The stones were fragmented in 97 percent of all patients, and the fragments were less than or equal to 5 mm in diameter in 46.8 percent. On the basis of an intention-to-treat analysis of all 600 patients, 21 percent receiving ursodiol and 9 percent receiving placebo (P less than 0.0001) had gallbladders that were free of stones after six months. Among those with completely radiolucent solitary stones less than 20 mm in diameter, 35 percent of the patients receiving ursodiol and 18 percent of those receiving placebo (P less than 0.001) were free of stones after six months. Biliary pain, usually mild, occurred in 73 percent of all patients but in only 13 percent of those who were free of stones after three and six months (P less than 0.01). There were few adverse events. Only diarrhea occurred with a significantly different frequency in the two groups: 32.6 percent were affected in the ursodiol group, as compared with 24.7 percent in the placebo group (P less than 0.04). Severe biliary pain occurred in 1.5 percent of all patients, acute cholecystitis in 1.0 percent, and acute pancreatitis in 1.5 percent; endoscopic sphincterotomy was performed in 0.5 percent, and cholecystectomy in 2.5 percent.

Although the central venous pressure decreased significantly from 15.2 +\/- 0.84 to 8.8 +\/- 0.92 mm Hg (p less than 0.0001), the mean arterial pressure increased significantly from 41.5 +\/- 2.54 to 53.5 +\/- 2.21 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). In addition, pH increased significantly from 7.31 +\/- 0.01 (SEM) to 7.43 +\/- 0.001 (SEM) (p less than 0.001) and oxygenation index (arterial oxygen tension\/inspired oxygen fraction) from 119 +\/- 15.2 (SEM) to 214 +\/- 27.0 (SEM) (p less than 0.001). Hemodynamic improvement during slow continuous extracorporeal fluid removal allowed a significant decrease of the catecholamine infusion rate. After normovolemia had been achieved, continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration had to be continued in four children because of persistent anuria. Eight patients could be weaned from artificial ventilation and vasopressor support. Two patients died without recovery of renal function and one with restored renal function. Slow continuous ultrafiltration and continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration improve the cardiovascular function in children with low cardiac output by optimizing the preload conditions of the failing heart. In addition, they improve acid-base balance and pulmonary gas exchange. ","labels_t":"general pathological conditions"}
{"text":"Factors determining success and energy requirements for cardioversion of atrial fibrillation. Factors thought to affect the success of and energy requirements for cardioversion of atrial fibrillation were studied in 80 (49 male, 31 female) patients aged 21-88 (mean 61.5 years). Transthoracic impedance was measured in advance of the countershock using a 30 kHz low amplitude AC current passed through self-adhesive ECG\/defibrillator pads (diameters 8-12 cm) applied to the chest in the antero-posterior (AP) position in 57 patients and the anteroapical (AA) position in 23 patients. Mean transthoracic impedance for all patients was 69.3 +\/- 16 (SD) ohms (range 39-131 ohms), but transthoracic impedance was significantly greater in the AA than the AP position (75.4 +\/- 13 vs. 66.7 +\/- 16 ohms, p = 0.02). Initial energy was 50 J (delivered) and was gradually increased to a maximum of 360 J if required. Cardioversion was successful in 73 of 80 (91.2 per cent), and low energy shocks (less than or equal to 200 J) were successful in 45 of 80 (56.2 per cent) patients. Using single factor analysis, sex, left atrial enlargement, electrode pad positions, aetiology of atrial fibrillation, presence of left ventricular failure, and prior treatment with verapamil or beta-adrenergic blockers were not significant determinants of cardioversion success or success of low energy shocks but prior treatment with digoxin was, both for cardioversion success and success at low energies. In patients with transthoracic impedance less than or equal to 70 ohms, low energy shocks were more often successful (33 or 50, 66 per cent) than in patients with transthoracic impedance greater than 70 ohms (12 of 30, 40 per cent), p = 0.04. Using univariate analysis, cardioversion success with low energy shocks was not only significantly associated with prior treatment with digoxin but also with the duration of atrial fibrillation (24 hours to one month and one month to three years) and for shocks of less than or equal to 100 J, with prior treatment with amiodarone. Multifactorial linear regression analysis selected, in rank order, only duration of atrial fibrillation of 24 hours to less than one month and one month to three years as significant predictors of both cardioversion success irrespective of shock strength, and success of low energy shocks.

{"text":"Ocular manifestations of onchocerciasis in a rain forest area of west Africa. The epidemiology and natural history of onchocerciasis and its ocular complications in rain forest areas are poorly understood. The present study was conducted on a rubber plantation in a hyperendemic area in the rain forest of Liberia, West Africa, where 800 persons were examined. The prevalence of infection was 84% overall 29% had intraocular microfilariae, and 2.4% were blind in one or both eyes. Onchocerciasis was the cause of all binocular blindness and one-third of all visual impairment. Over half of the visual impairment caused by onchocerciasis was due to posterior segment diseases. Chorioretinal changes were present in 75% of people, and included intraretinal pigment clumping in 52% and retinal pigment epithelium atrophy in 32%. Atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium was associated with increasing age and severity of infection. Intraretinal pigment was strongly associated with anterior uveitis. There was a strong correlation between uveitis and the inflammatory chorioretinal sequelae: retinitis, intraretinal pigment, subretinal fibrosis, and optic neuropathy. These findings indicate that considerable visual impairment associated with rain forest onchocerciasis is common and is due largely to chorioretinal disease.

{"text":"Interphase cytogenetic analysis in the diagnosis and study of neoplastic disorders. Cytogenetic information usually is obtained through the direct analysis of chromosomes from cells arrested in metaphase. Recently, advances in molecular genetics have made it possible to acquire cytogenetic information through the study of interphase and terminally differentiated cells. By using chromosome-specific DNA probes or probes that are specific for certain chromosomal regions, and by employing techniques of in situ hybridization along with nonradioactive detection methods, it is now possible to detect numerical and structural chromosomal abnormalities from nonmetaphase cells. When used as an adjunct to conventional cytogenetic analysis or when used together with knowledge of established cytogenetic findings for a particular malignancy, this new technology can serve to broaden the scope and utility of cytogenetic analysis beyond the limits of the present metaphase-based technology. Interphase cytogenetic analysis has application to the diagnosis and study of neoplastic disorders and, thus, has particular importance in pathology. ","labels_t":"general pathological conditions"}
{"text":"Serial magnetic resonance imaging of hamstring anterior cruciate ligament autografts during the first year of implantation. A preliminary study. A prospective, observational study was performed to document the serial changes in the magnetic resonance signal of devascularized, hamstring ACL autografts during the 1st year of implantation. Twenty-one ACL deficient knees (14 chronic, 7 acute) were reconstructed. Instability developed in five knees within the first 6 months of graft implantation (24%). Magnetic resonance examinations were performed at 1, 6, 12, 24, 36, and greater than 48 weeks postoperatively (repetition time 1500, echo delay time = 50). A total of 104 scans were reviewed (average, five per knee). The ACL graft was divided into four unequal size zones for analysis. The proximal, middle, and distal thirds of the intraarticular portion of the graft and the portion of the graft within the tibial tunnel were independently analyzed. The magnetic resonance signal in each portion of the graft was graded on a scale with (I) being a normal signal, (II) greater than 50% of the total volume of the graft having a normal signal, (III) less than 50% of the graft having a normal signal, and (IV) 100% of the graft having an increased signal. The increased magnetic resonance signal of the ACL graft was observed to be regionalized and confined to the distal two-thirds of the intraarticular portion of the graft. The portion of the graft exiting the femoral tunnel and within the tibial tunnel retained a normal magnetic resonance signal. The increases in magnetic resonance graft signal were time-dependent, became well established by 3 months, and remained unchanged at 1 year. The clinical outcome could not be predicted based on the magnetic resonance signal of the graft. ","labels_t":"general pathological conditions"}
{"text":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: fasting plasma levels of cysteine and inorganic sulfate are normal, as are brain contents of cysteine. Recent reports suggest that amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is caused by one or more unidentified neurotoxins that are poorly metabolized in patients to less toxic and more readily excreted compounds, and that a genetically determined defect in cysteine degradation and in inorganic sulfate production is the mechanism underlying a failure to metabolize xenobiotics normally in ALS. We measured concentrations of total cysteine and of inorganic sulfate in the plasma of age-matched groups of ALS patients and healthy control subjects and found no differences. L-Cysteine, a putative endogenous neurotoxin in ALS, was present in equal concentrations in autopsied brain from ALS patients and controls. ","labels_t":"neoplasms"}
{"text":"Conservative therapy for adnexal torsion. A case report. Adnexal torsion has traditionally been treated with oophorectomy because of the fear that untwisting the ovarian pedicle may result in a thrombotic embolus. Such a patient had bilateral adnexal torsion secondary to dermoid cysts. Since standard therapy, oophorectomy, was performed, the patient was surgically castrated. A review of the literature revealed no reported cases of a thrombotic embolus arising from the untwisting of twisted adnexa and supported conservation of the adnexa rather than routine extirpation, except when necrotic.
